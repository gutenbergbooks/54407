<p>The contents of this book are among the last
writings of Max Heindel, the mystic. They contain
some of his deepest thoughts, and are the result of
years of research and occult investigation. He, too,
could say as did Parsifal: “Through error and through
suffering I came, through many failures and through
countless woes.” At last he was given the living water
with which he was able to quench the spiritual thirst
of many souls. He also developed to their depths
pity and love, and could feel the heart throbs of suffering
humanity.</p>

<p>Strong souls are usually endowed with great energy
and impulse, and through these very forces, they
forge to the front ranks though they often suffer
much. As a result they are filled with compassion for
others. The writer of these lessons sacrificed his physical
body on the altar of service.</p>

<p>In writing the books and monthly lessons of the
Fellowship, in his lectures and class work, and in the
arduous pioneer work of establishing Headquarters
within the short span of ten years, Max Heindel accomplished
more than many who are blessed with perfect
health could have accomplished in a lifetime. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
first book, his masterpiece, “The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception,”
was written under the direct guidance
of the Elder Brothers of the Rose Cross. It carries a
vital message to the world. It satisfies not alone the
intellect, but also the heart. His “Freemasonry
and Catholicism,” has found its way into many Masonic
libraries. The occultist has received much from
the book entitled, “The Web of Destiny,” which is a
mine of mystical knowledge and helpful occult truths.
It is also a guide to the investigator, establishing
danger signals for the venturesome ones who wish to
take heaven by storm. To the science of astrology he
has given more in a few years than has previously
been discovered in centuries. His two valuable works,
“Simplified Scientific Astrology” and “The Message
of the Stars,” deal largely with the spiritual and medical
aspects of astrology. The latter gives methods
of diagnosis and healing which form a valuable
addition to the works of other authors, both ancient
and modern. These books may be found in the libraries
of many doctors of the old school.</p>

<p>In “Gleanings of a Mystic” are found twenty-four
lessons which were formerly sent out to students. It
is the wish of the writer of this introduction that these
lessons may carry a message of love and cheer to the
soul-hungry reader and hope to the disconsolate one.</p>

<p class="center">PART I</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It is no</span> rare occurrence to receive questions relating
to Initiation, and we are also frequently asked
to state whether this order or that society is genuine,
and whether the initiations they offer to all comers
who have the price are <i lang="la">bona fide</i>. For that reason it
seems necessary to write a treatise on the subject so
that students of the Rosicrucian Fellowship may have
an official statement for reference and guidance in
the future.</p>

<p>In the first place let it be clearly understood that
we consider it reprehensible to express condemnation
of any society or order, no matter what its practices.
It may be perfectly sincere and honest <em>according to
its light</em>. We do not believe that we rise in the opinion
of discriminating men and women by speaking in
disparaging terms of others; neither are we laboring
under the delusion that <em>we</em> have all the truth and other
societies are plunged in Egyptian darkness. We
reiterate what we have often said before, that all re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>ligions
have been given to mankind by the Recording
Angels, who know the spiritual requirements of each
class, nation, and race, and have the intelligence to
give to each a form of worship perfectly suited to its
particular need; that thus Hinduism is suited to the
Hindu, Mohammedanism to the Arab, and the Christian
religion to those born in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>The Mystery Schools of each religion furnish to the
more advanced members of the race or nation embracing
it a higher teaching, which, <em>if lived</em>, advances
them into a higher sphere of spirituality than their
brethren. But as the religion of the backward races
is of a lower order than the religion of the pioneers,
the Christian nations, so also the <em>Mystery Teaching of
the East is more elementary than that of the West</em>,
and the Hindu or Chinese Initiate is on a correspondingly
lower rung of the ladder of attainment than the
Western Mystic. Please ponder this well so that you
may not fall a victim to misguided people who try to
persuade others that the Christian religion is crude
compared with oriental cults. Ever westward in the
wake of the shining sun, the light of the world, has
gone the star of empire, and is it not reasonable to
suppose that the spiritual light has kept pace with
civilization, or even preceded it as thought precedes
action? We hold that such is the case, that the Christian
religion is the loftiest yet given to man, and that
to repudiate the Christian religion, esoteric or exoteric,
for any of the older systems is analogous to preferring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
the older textbooks of science to the newer ones which
embrace discoveries to date.</p>

<p>Neither are the practices of Eastern aspirants to the
higher life to be imitated by Westerners; we refer
particularly to the breathing exercises. They are both
beneficial and necessary to the unfoldment of the
Hindu, but it is otherwise with the Western aspirant.
To him it is dangerous to practice breathing exercises
for soul unfoldment; they will even prove subversive
of soul growth, and they are, moreover, absolutely unnecessary.
The reason is this:</p>

<p>During involution the threefold spirit has become
gradually incrusted in a threefold body. In the Atlantean
Epoch man was at the nadir of materiality.
We are just now rounding the lowest point on the arc
of involution, and starting upward on the arc
of evolution. At this point, then, all mankind is
immured in this earthly prison house to such a degree
that spiritual vibrations are almost killed. This is, of
course, particularly true of the backward races and
the lower classes in the Western world. The atoms in
such backward race bodies are vibrating at an exceedingly
low rate, and when in the course of time one of
these people develops to a point where it is possible to
further him upon the path of attainment, it is necessary
to raise this vibratory pitch of the atom so that
the vital body, which is the medium of occult growth,
may to a certain extent be liberated from the deadening
force of the physical atom. This result is at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>tained
by means of breathing exercises, which in time
accelerate the vibration of the atom, and allow the
spiritual growth necessary to the individual to take
place.</p>

<p>These exercises may also be used by a great number
of people in the Western world, particularly those who
are not at all concerned about their spiritual advancement.
But even among those who desire soul growth
there are many who are not yet at the point where
the atoms of their bodies have evolved to such a pitch
of vibration that acceleration beyond the usual measure
would injure them. Here the breathing exercises
would do no harm; but if given to a person who is
really at the point where he can enter the path of
advancement ordinarily mapped out for the Hindu’s
precocious brothers and sisters in the West, in other
words, when he is nearly ready for Initiation and
when he would be benefited <em>by spiritual exercises</em>,
then the case is far otherwise.</p>

<p>During the aeons which we have spent in evolution
since the time when we were in Hindu bodies, our
atoms have accelerated their vibratory pitch enormously,
and as said in the case of one who is really
nearly ready for Initiation, the pitch of vibration is
higher than that of the average man or woman. Therefore
he does not need breathing exercises to <em>accelerate</em>
this pitch, but certain spiritual exercises suited to him
individually which will advance him on the proper
path. If such a person at this critical period meets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
some one who ignorantly or unscrupulously gives him
breathing exercises, and if he follows the instructions
accurately in the hope of <em>getting quick results</em>, he will
get them quickly but in a manner he has not looked
for, since the vibratory rate of the atoms in his body
will in a very short time become accelerated to such a
pitch that it will seem to him as if he were walking
on air; then also an improper cleavage of the vital
body may take place, and either consumption or insanity
follows. Now please put this down where it
will burn itself into your consciousness in letters of
fire: <em>Initiation is a spiritual process, and spiritual
progress cannot be accomplished by physical means,
but only by spiritual exercises.</em></p>

<p>There are many orders in the West which profess
to <em>initiate anyone who has the price</em>. Some of these
orders have names closely resembling our own, and
we are constantly asked by students whether they are
affiliated with us. In order to settle this once and for
all, please note that the Rosicrucian Fellowship has
constantly taught that <em>no spiritual gift may ever be
traded for money</em>. If you bear this in mind, you may
know we have no connection with any order which demands
money for the transference of spiritual power.
He who has something to give of a truly spiritual nature
will not barter it for money. I received a particular
injunction to this effect from the Elder Brothers
in the Rosicrucian Temple, when they told me to
go to the English speaking world as their messenger,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
a claim I do not expect you to believe <em>save as you see
it justified by fruits</em>.</p>

<p>Now, however, about Initiation: What is it? Is it
ceremony as claimed by these other orders? If so, any
order can certainly invent ceremonies of a more or less
elaborate kind. They may by flowing robes and
clashing swords appeal to the emotions; they may
appeal to the sense of wonder and awe by rattling
chains and by deep sounding gongs, and thus produce
in their members an “<em>occult feeling</em>.” Many revel
in the adventures and experiences of the hero in
“The Brother of the Third Degree,” thinking that
this is surely Initiation, but I tell you that it is very
far from being the case. <em>No ceremony can ever give to
any one that inward experience</em> which constitutes
Initiation, no matter how much is charged or how
fearful the oaths, how awful or beautiful the ceremony,
or how gorgeous the robes, any more than passing
through a ceremony can convert a sinner and
make him a saint, for conversion is to the exoteric religionist
exactly what Initiation is in the higher mysticism.
Please consider this point thoroughly, and
you will have the key to the problem.</p>

<p>Do you think that any one could go to a person of
depraved character and agree to convert him for a
certain sum and carry out his part of the agreement?
Surely you know that no amount of money could
bring about that change in a man’s character. Ask a
true convert where he got his religion and how he got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
it. One may tell you that he received it upon the
road as he was walking along; another says that the
light and the change came to him in the solitude of his
room; another that the <em>light struck</em> him as it struck
Paul upon the road to Damascus, and forced him to
change. Every one has a different experience, but it
is in every case <em>an inward experience</em>, and the outward
manifestation of that inward experience is that <em>it
changes the man’s whole life</em> from the very least to
the very greatest aspects.</p>

<p>So it is also with Initiation; it is an inward experience,
entirely <em>separate and apart from any ceremonial
whatever</em>, and therefore it is an absolute impossibility
that any one could sell it to any one else.
Initiation changes a man’s whole life. It gives
him a confidence that he never possessed before. It
clothes him with a mantle of authority that never can
be taken from him. No matter what the circumstances
in life, it sheds a light upon his whole being that is
simply wonderful. Nor can any ceremony effect such
a change. We therefore hold that anyone who offers
initiation into an occult order by ceremonials to every
one who has the price, brands himself as an imposter.
For the true teacher, if he were approached by an
aspirant with an offer of money for spiritual attainment
would answer indignantly in the words used by
Peter to Simon, the sorcerer, who offered him money
for spiritual powers: “Thy silver perish with thee.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">To obtain</span> a better understanding of what constitutes
Initiation and what the prerequisites are,
let the student first fix firmly in his mind the fact
that humanity as a whole is slowly progressing upon
the path of evolution, and thus very slowly, almost
imperceptibly, attaining higher and higher states of
consciousness. The path of evolution is a spiral when
we regard it from the physical side only, but a lemniscate
when viewed in both its physical and spiritual
phases. (See the diagram of chemical caduceus in <cite>The
Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception</cite>, page 410.) In the lemniscate,
or figure 8, there are two circles which converge
to a central point, which circles may be taken
to symbolize the immortal spirit, the evolving ego.
One of the circles signifies its life in the physical
world from birth to death. During this span of time
it sows a seed by every act and should reap in return
a certain amount of experience. But as we may sow
seed in the field and lose return on that which falls on
stony ground, among thorns, et cetera, so also may the
seed of opportunity be wasted because of neglect to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
till the soil and the life will then be barren of fruit.
Conversely, as diligence and care in cultivation increase
the productive power of garden seed enormously,
so earnest application to the business of life—improvement
of opportunities to learn life’s lessons
and extract from our environment the experience it
holds—brings added opportunities; and at the end of
the life-day the ego finds itself at the door of death
laden with the richest fruits of life.</p>

<p>The objective work of physical existence over, the
race run, and the day of action spent, the ego enters
upon the subjective work of assimilation accomplished
during its sojourn in the invisible worlds, which it
traverses during the period from death to birth, symbolized
by the other ring of the lemniscate. As the
method of accomplishing this assimilation has been
most minutely described in various parts of our literature,
it is needless to repeat it here. Suffice it to say
that at the time when an ego arrives at the central
point in the lemniscate, which divides the physical
from the psychic worlds and which we call the gate of
birth or death according to whether the ego is entering
or leaving the realm where we, ourselves, happen
to be at the time, it has with it an aggregate of faculties
or talents acquired in all its previous lives, which
it may then put to usury or bury during the coming
life-day as it sees fit; but upon the use it makes of
what it has, depends the amount of soul growth it
makes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<p>If for many lives it caters mainly to the lower nature,
which lives to eat, drink, and be merry, or if it
dreams its life away in metaphysical speculations
upon nature and God, sedulously abstaining from all
unnecessary action, it is gradually passed and left behind
by the more active and progressive. Great companies
of these idlers form what we know as “backward
races”; while the active, alert, and wide-awake
who improve a larger percentage of their opportunities,
are the pioneers. Contrary to the commonly accepted
idea, this applies also to those engaged in industrial
work. Their money-getting is only an incident,
an incentive, and entirely apart from this phase
their work is as spiritual as or even more so than that
of those who spend their time in prayer to the prejudice
of useful work.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it will be clear that the
method of soul growth as accomplished by the process
of evolution requires <em>action</em> in the physical life, followed
in the post-mortem state by a <em>ruminating process</em>,
during which the lessons of life are extracted and
thoroughly incorporated into the consciousness of the
ego, though the experiences themselves are forgotten—as
we forget our labor in learning the multiplication
table, though the faculty of using it remains.</p>

<p>This exceedingly slow and tedious process is perfectly
suited to the needs of the masses; but there are
some who habitually exhaust the experiences commonly
given, thus requiring and meriting a larger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
scope for their energies. Difference of temperament
is responsible for their division into two classes.</p>

<p>One class, led by their devotion to Christ, simply
follow the dictates of the heart in their work of love
for their fellows—beautiful characters, beacon lights
of love in a suffering world, never actuated by selfish
motives, always ready to forego personal comfort to
aid others. Such were the saints; they worked as
they prayed; they never shirked in either direction.
Nor are they dead today. The earth would be a
barren wilderness in spite of all its civilization did
not their beautiful feet circle it on errands of mercy,
were not the lives of sufferers made brighter by the
light of hope which radiates from their beautiful
faces. Had they but the knowledge possessed by the
other class they would indeed outdistance all in the
race for the Kingdom.</p>

<p>Mind is the predominating feature of the other
class. In order to aid it in its efforts toward attainment,
mystery schools were early established wherein
the world drama was played to give the aspiring soul
while he was entranced, answers to the questions of
the origin and destiny of humanity. When awakened,
he was instructed in the sacred science of how to climb
higher by following the method of nature—which is
God in manifestation—by sowing the seed of action,
meditating upon the experience, and incorporating
the essential moral to make thereby commensurate
soul growth; also with this important feature, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
whereas in the ordinary course of things a whole life
is devoted to sowing and a whole post-mortem existence
to ruminating and incorporating the soul substance,
this cycle of a thousand years, more or less,
may be reduced to a day, as held by the mystic maxim,
“A day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years
as one day.” To be explicit, whatever work has been
done during a single day, if ruminated over at night
before crossing the neutral point between waking
and sleeping, may thus be incorporated into the consciousness
of the spirit as usable soul power. When
that exercise is faithfully performed, the sins of each
day thus reviewed are actually blotted out, and the
man commences each day as if it were a new life, with
the added soul power gained in all the preceding days
of his probationary life.</p>

<p>But!—yes, there is a great big <em>BUT; nature is not
to be cheated</em>; God is not to be mocked. “Whatsoever
a man soweth, that shall he also reap.” Let no one
think that the mere perfunctory review of the happenings
of a day with perhaps the light-hearted admission
of, “I wish I had not done that,” when reviewing
a scene where he did something palpably
wrong, will save him from the wrath to come. When
we pass out of the body into purgatory at death and
the panorama of our past life unfolds in reverse order
to show us first the effects and then the causes which
produced them, we feel in intensified measure the pain
we gave others; and unless we perform our exercises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
in a similar manner <em>so that we live each evening our
hell</em> as merited that day, acutely sensible of every
pang we have inflicted, it will avail nothing. We must
also endeavor to feel in the same intense manner,
gratitude for kindness received from others, and
approbation on account of the good we ourselves have
done.</p>

<p>Only thus are we really living the post-mortem
existence and advancing scientifically towards the
goal of Initiation. The greatest danger of the aspirant
upon this path is that he may become enmeshed in the
snare of egotism, and his only safeguard is to cultivate
the faculties of faith, devotion, and an all-embracing
sympathy. It is difficult, but it can be done, and
when it has been accomplished the man or woman becomes
a wonderful power for good in the world.</p>

<p>Now, if the student has pondered the preceding
argument well, he has probably grasped the analogy
between the <em>long cycle</em> of evolution and the short
<em>cycles</em> or steps used upon the path of preparation. It
should be quite clear that no one can do this post-mortem
work for him and transmit to him the resulting
soul growth, any more than one can eat the physical
food of another and transmit to him the sustenance
and growth. You think it preposterous when a
priesthood offers to shorten the sojourn of a soul in
purgatory. How, then, can you believe that anyone
else can—no matter what the consideration—obviate
the necessity of a number of purgatorial existences for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
your benefit and transmit to you at once the usable
soul power you would have acquired had you pursued
the ordinary course of life to the day you are ready
for Initiation? Yet this is what the offer to initiate
a person not yet upon the threshold means. You
must have the soul power requisite for Initiation or
no one can initiate you. If you have it, you are upon
the threshold by your own efforts, beholden to no one,
and may demand Initiation as a right which none
would dare dispute or withhold. If you have it not
and could buy it, it would be cheap at twenty-five
million dollars, and the man who offers it for twenty-five
dollars is as ridiculous as his dupe. Please remember
that if anyone offers to initiate you into an
occult order, no matter if he calls it “Rosicrucian” or
by any other name, his demand of an initiation fee at
once stamps him as an impostor, explanations to the
effect that the fee is used to purchase regalia, et cetera,
are only added evidence of the fraudulent nature of
the order for it is said, “Initiation is most emphatically
not an outward ceremony, but an inward experience.”
I may further add that the Elder Brothers
of the Rose Cross in the Mystic Temple where I received
the Light made it a condition that their <em>sacred
science must never be put in the balance against a
coin</em>. Freely had I received, and freely was I required
to give. This injunction I have obeyed, both in spirit
and to the letter, as all know who have had dealings
with the Rosicrucian Fellowship.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Sacrament of Communion</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="center">PART I</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">To obtain</span> a thorough understanding of the deep
and far-reaching significance of the manner in
which the Sacrament of Communion was instituted, it
is necessary to consider the evolution of our planet
and of composite man, also the chemistry of foods and
their influence on humanity. For the sake of lucidity
we will briefly recapitulate the Rosicrucian teachings
on the various points involved. They have been given
at length in the <cite>Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception</cite> and
our other works.</p>

<p>The Virgin Spirits, which are now mankind, commenced
their pilgrimage through matter in the dawn
of time, that by the friction of concrete existence their
latent powers might be transmuted to kinetic energy
as usable soul power. Three successive veils of increasingly
dense matter were acquired by the involving
spirits during the Saturn, Sun, and Moon Periods.
Thus each spirit was separated from all other spirits,
and the consciousness which could not penetrate the
prison wall of matter and communicate with others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
was forced to turn inwards, and in so doing it discovered—<span class="smcap lowercase">ITSELF</span>.
Thus self-consciousness was attained.</p>

<p>A further crystallization of the before mentioned
veils took place in the Earth Period during the
Polarian, Hyperborean, and Lemurian Epochs. In
the Atlantean Epoch, mind was added as a focusing
point between spirit and body, completing the constitution
of composite man, who was then equipped
to conquer the world and generate soul power by endeavor
and experience, each having free will and
choice except as limited by the laws of nature and his
own previous acts.</p>

<p>During the time man-in-the-making was thus evolving,
great creative Hierarchies guided his every step.
Absolutely nothing was left to chance. Even the
food he ate was chosen for him so that he might obtain
the appropriate material wherewith to build the various
vehicles of consciousness necessary to accomplish
the process of soul growth. The Bible mentions the
various stages, though it misplaces Nimrod, making
him to symbolize the Atlantean kings who lived <em>before</em>
the Flood.</p>

<p>In the Polarian Epoch pure mineral matter became
a constituent part of man; thus <em>Adam</em> was made
of earth, that is, so far as his dense body was concerned.</p>

<p>In the Hyperborean Epoch the vital body was
added, and thus his constitution became plantlike,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
and <em>Cain</em>, the man of that time, lived on the fruits of
the soil.</p>

<p>The Lemurian Epoch saw the evolution of a desire
body, which made man like the present animals. Then
milk, the product of living animals, was added to
human diet. <em>Abel</em> was a shepherd, but it is nowhere
stated that he killed an animal.</p>

<p>At that time mankind lived innocently and peacefully
in the misty atmosphere which enveloped the
earth during the latter part of the Lemurian Epoch, as
described in the chapter on “Baptism.” Men were
then like children under the care of a common father,
until the mind was given to all in the beginning of
Atlantis. Thought activity breaks down tissue which
must be replaced; the lower and more material the
thought, the greater the havoc and the more pressing
the need for albumen wherewith to make quick repairs.
Hence necessity, the mother of invention, inaugurated
the loathsome practice of flesh eating, and
so long as we continue to think along purely business
or material lines we shall have to go on using our
stomachs as receptacles for the decaying corpses of
our murdered animal victims. Yet we shall see later
that flesh food has enabled us to make the wonderful
material progress achieved in the Western World,
while the vegetarian Hindus and Chinese have remained
in an almost savage state. It seems sad to
contemplate that they will be forced to follow in our
steps and shed the blood of our fellow creatures when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
we shall have outgrown the barbarous practice as we
have ceased cannibalism.</p>

<p>The more spiritual we grow, the more our thoughts
will harmonize with the rhythm of our body, and the
less albumen will be needed to build tissue. Consequently,
a vegetable diet will suffice our needs.
Pythagoras advised abstinence from legumes to <em>advanced</em>
scholars because they are rich in albumen and
apt to revive lower appetites. Let not every student
who reads this rashly conclude to eliminate legumes
from his diet. Most of us are not yet ready for such
extremes; we would not even advise all students
to abstain entirely from meat. The change should
come from within. It may be safely stated, however,
that most people eat entirely too much meat for their
good; but this is in a certain sense a digression, so we
will revert to the further evolution of humanity in so
far as it has a bearing upon the Sacrament of Communion.</p>

<p>In due time the dense mist which enveloped the
earth cooled, condensed, and flooded the various
basins. The atmosphere cleared, and concurrently
with this atmospheric change a physiological adaptation
in man took place. The gill clefts which had enabled
him to breathe in the dense water laden air
(and which are seen in the human foetus to this day)
gradually atrophied, and their function was taken
over by the lungs, the pure air passing to and from
them through the larynx. This allowed the spirit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
hitherto penned up within the veil of flesh, to express
itself in word and act.</p>

<p>There in the middle of Atlantis the sun first shone
upon <span class="smcap">man</span> as we know him; there he was <em>first born</em>
into the world. Until then he had been under the
absolute control of great spiritual Hierarchies, mute,
without voice or choice in matters pertaining to his
education, as a child is now under the control of its
parents.</p>

<p>But on the day when he finally emerged from the
dense atmosphere of Atlantis; when he first beheld
the mountains silhouetted in clear, sharp contours
against the azure vault of heaven; when he first saw
the beauties of moor and meadow, the moving creatures,
birds in the air, and his fellow man; when his
vision was undimmed by the partial obscuration of the
mist which had previously hampered perception;
above all, when he perceived <span class="smcap lowercase">HIMSELF</span> as <em>separate</em> and
<em>apart from all others</em>, there burst from his lips the
glorious, triumphant cry, “<span class="smcap lowercase">I AM</span>.”</p>

<p>At that point he had acquired faculties which
equipped him to enter the school of experience, the
phenomenal world, as a free agent to learn the lessons
of life, untrammeled save by the <em>laws of nature</em>,
which are his safeguards, and the reaction of his own
previous acts, which become <em>destiny</em>.</p>

<p>The diet containing an excess of albumen from the
flesh wherewith he gorged himself, taxed his liver beyond
capacity and clogged the system, making him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
morose, sullen, and brutish. He was fast losing the
spiritual sight which revealed to him the guardian
angels whom he trusted, and he saw only the <em>forms</em> of
animals and men. The spirits with whom he had lived
in love and brotherhood during early Atlantis were
obscured by the veil of flesh. It was all so strange,
and he <em>feared</em> them.</p>

<p>Therefore it became necessary to give him a <em>new
food</em> that could aid his spirit to overpower the highly
individualized molecules of flesh (as explained in the
<cite>Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception</cite>, chapter on Assimilation,
p. 457), brace it for battle with the world, and
spur it on to self-assertion.</p>

<p>As our visible bodies composed of chemical compounds
can thrive only upon chemical aliment, so it
requires spirit to act upon spirit to aid in breaking
up the heavy proteid and in stimulating the drooping
human spirit.</p>

<p>The emergence from flooded Atlantis, the liberation
of humanity from the absolute rulership of visible
superhuman guardians, their placement under <em>the law
of consequence and the laws of nature</em>, and <em>the gift of</em>
<span class="smcap lowercase">WINE</span> are described in the stories of Noah and Moses,
which are different accounts of the same event.</p>

<p>Both Noah and Moses led their followers through
the water. Moses calls heaven and earth to witness
that he has placed before them the blessing and the
curse, exhorts them to choose the good or take the
consequence of their actions; then he leaves them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>The phenomenon of the rainbow requires that the
sun be near the horizon, the nearer the better; also a
clear atmosphere, and a dark rain cloud in the opposite
quarter of the heavens. When under such conditions
an observer stands with his back to the sun,
he may see the sun’s rays refracted through the rain
drops as a rainbow. In early Atlantean times when
there had been no rain as yet and the atmosphere was
a warm, moist fog through which the sun appeared
as one of our arc lamps on a foggy day, the phenomenon
of the rainbow was an impossibility. It could
not have made its appearance until the mist had condensed
to rain, flooded the basins of the earth, and
left the atmosphere clear as described in the story of
Noah, which thus points <em>to the law of alternating
cycles</em> that brings day and night, summer and winter,
in unvarying sequence, and to which man is subject in
the present age.</p>

<p>Noah cultivated the vine and provided a spirit to
stimulate man. Thus, equipped with a composite
constitution, a composite diet appropriate thereto, and
divine laws to guide them, mankind were left to their
own devices in the battle of life.</p>

“<i>In Remembrance of Me.</i>”</h2></div>


<p class="center">PART II</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">“The Lord Jesus</span>, the same night in which
he was betrayed took bread; and when he had
given thanks, he brake it and said, Take, eat; this is
<span class="smcap lowercase">MY</span> body, which is broken for you. This do in remembrance
of me. After the same manner also he
took the cup, when he had supped, saying This cup
is the New Testament in <span class="smcap lowercase">MY</span> blood. This do ye, as oft
as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as
ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the
Lord’s death till he come. Wherefore, whosoever shall
eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily,
shall be guilty of the body and blood
of the Lord.... For he that eateth and drinketh
unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to
himself.... For this cause many are weak
and sickly among you, and many sleep.”—I Cor.
11:23-30.</p>

<p>In the foregoing passages there is a deeply hidden
esoteric meaning which is particularly obscured in the
English translation, but in the German, Latin, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
Greek, the student still has a hint as to what was
really intended by that last parting injunction of the
Savior to His disciples. Before examining this phase
of the subject, let us first consider the words, “in remembrance
of me.” We shall then perhaps be in
better condition to understand what is meant by the
“cup” and the “bread.”</p>

<p>Suppose a man from a distant country comes into
our midst and travels about from place to place.
Everywhere he will see small communities gathering
around the Table of the Lord to celebrate this most
sacred of all Christian rites, and should he ask why,
he would be told that they do this in remembrance of
One who lived a life nobler than any other has lived
upon this earth; One who was kindness and love personified;
One who was the servant of all, regardless
of gain or loss to self. Should this stranger then
compare the attitude of these religious communities
on Sunday at the celebration of this rite, with their
civic lives during the remainder of the week, what
would he see?</p>

<p>Every one among us goes out into the world to fight
the battle of existence. Under the law of necessity we
forget the love which should be the ruling factor in
Christian lives. Every man’s hand is against his
brother. Every one strives for position, wealth, and
power that goes with these attributes. We forget on
Monday what we reverently remembered on Sunday,
and all the world is poor in consequence. We also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
make a distinction between the bread and wine which
we drink at the so-called “Lord’s Table,” and the
food of which we partake during the intervals between
attendance at Communion. But there is no
warrant in the Scriptures for any such distinction, as
anyone may see, even in the English version, by leaving
out the words printed in italics which have been
inserted by the translators to give what they thought
was the sense of a passage. On the contrary, we are
told that whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do,
all should be done to the glory of God. Our every
act should be a prayer. The perfunctory “grace” at
meals is in reality a blasphemy, and the silent thought
of gratitude to the Giver of daily bread is far to be
preferred. When we remember at each meal that it
has been drawn from the substance of the earth, which
is the body of the indwelling Christ Spirit, we can
properly understand how that body is being broken
for us daily, and we can appreciate the loving kindness
which prompted Him thus to give Himself for
us; for let us also remember that there is not a moment,
day or night, that He is not suffering because
bound to this earth. When we thus eat and thus
realize the true situation, we are indeed declaring to
ourselves the death of the Lord, whose spirit is groaning
and travailing, waiting for the day of liberation
when there shall be no need of such a dense environment
as we now require.</p>

<p>But there is another, a greater and more wonderful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
mystery hidden in these words of the Christ. Richard
Wagner, with the rare intuition of the master musician,
sensed this idea when he sat in meditation by
the Zurich Sea on a Good Friday, and there flashed
into his mind the thought, “What connection is there
between the death of the Savior and the millions of
seeds sprouting forth from the earth at this time of
the year?” If we meditate upon that life which is
annually poured out in the spring, we see it as something
gigantic and awe-inspiring; a flood of life which
transforms the globe from one of frozen death to rejuvenated
life in a short space of time; and the life
which thus diffuses itself in the budding of millions
and millions of plants is the life of the Earth Spirit.</p>

<p>From that come both the wheat and the grape. They
are the body and blood of the imprisoned Earth Spirit,
given to sustain mankind during the present phase of
its evolution. We repudiate the contention of people
who claim that the world owes them a living, regardless
of their own efforts and without <em>material</em> responsibility
on their part, but we nevertheless insist that
there is a <em>spiritual</em> responsibility connected with the
bread and wine given at the Lord’s Supper: <em>It must
be eaten worthily, otherwise, under pain of ill health
and even death</em>. This from the ordinary manner of
reading would seem far-fetched, but when we bring
the light of esotericism to bear, examine other translations
of the Bible, and look at conditions in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
world as we find them today, we shall see that it is
not so far-fetched after all.</p>

<p>To begin with, we must go back to the time when
man lived under the guardianship of the angels,
unconsciously building the body which he now uses.
That was in ancient Lemuria. A brain was needed
for the evolution of thought, and a larynx for
verbal expression of the same. Therefore, half of
the creative force was turned upwards and used
by man to form these organs. Thus mankind became
single sexed and was forced to seek a complement
when it was necessary to create a new body to
serve as an instrument in a higher phase of evolution.</p>

<p>While the act of love was consummated under the
wise guardianship of the angels, man’s existence was
free from sorrow, pain, and death. But when, under
the tutelage of the Lucifer Spirits, he ate of the Tree
of Knowledge and perpetuated the race without regard
for interplanetary lines of force, he transgressed
the law, and the bodies thus formed crystallized unduly,
and became subject to death in a much more
perceptible manner than had hitherto been the case.
Thus he was forced to create new bodies more frequently
as the span of life in them shortened. Celestial
warders of the creative force drove him from the
garden of <em>love</em> into the wilderness of the world, and
he was made responsible for his actions under the
cosmic <em>law</em> which governs the universe. Thus for
ages he struggled on, seeking to work out his own sal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>vation,
and the earth in consequence crystallized more
and more.</p>

<p>Divine hierarchies, the Christ Spirit included,
worked upon the earth from without as the group
spirit guides the animals under its protectorate; but as
Paul truly says, none could be justified under the
law, for under the law all sinned, and all must die.
There is in the old covenant no hope beyond the present,
save a foreshadowing of <em>one who is to come</em> and
restore righteousness. Thus John tells us that the <em>law</em>
was given by Moses, and <em>grace</em> came by the Lord Jesus
Christ. But <em>what is grace</em>? Can grace work contrary
to law and abrogate it entirely? Certainly not.
The laws of God are steadfast and sure, or the universe
would become chaos. The law of gravity keeps
our houses in position relative to other houses, so that
when we leave them we may know of a surety that we
shall find them in the same place upon returning.
Likewise all other departments in the universe are
subject to immutable laws.</p>

<p>As <em>law, apart from love, gave birth to sin, so the
child of law, tempered with love, is grace</em>. Take an
example from our concrete social conditions: We have
laws which decree a certain penalty for a specified
offense, and when the law is carried out, we call it
<em>justice</em>. But long experience is beginning to teach us
that justice, pure and simple, is like the Colchian
dragon’s teeth, and breeds strife and struggle in increasing
measure. The criminal, so-called, remains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
criminal and becomes more and more hardened under
the ministrations of law; but when the milder regime
of the present day allows one who has transgressed to
go under suspended sentence, then <em>he is under grace</em>
and not under law. Thus, also the Christian, who aims
to follow in the Master’s steps, is emancipated from
the law of sin by grace, provided he forsake the path
of sin.</p>

<p>It was the sin of our progenitors in ancient Lemuria
that <em>they scattered their seed</em> regardless of law and
without love. But it is the privilege of the Christian
to redeem himself by purity of life in remembrance
of the Lord. John says, “His seed remaineth in
him,” and this is the hidden meaning of the bread
and wine. In the English version we read simply:
“This is the <em>cup</em> of the New Testament,” but in the
German the word for cup is “<i lang="de">Kelch</i>,” and in the
Latin, “<i lang="la">Calix</i>,” both meaning the outer covering of
the seed pod of the flower. In the Greek we have a
still more subtle meaning, not conveyed in other
languages, in the word “<i lang="el">poterion</i>,” a meaning which
will be evident when we consider the etymology of the
word “pot.” This at once gives us the same idea as
the chalice or calix—a receptacle; and the Latin
“<i lang="la">potare</i>” (to drink) also shows that the “cup” is
a receptacle capable of holding a fluid. Our English
words “potent” and “impotent,” meaning to possess
or to lack virile strength, further show the meaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
of this Greek word, which foreshadows the evolution
from man to superman.</p>

<p>We have already lived through a mineral, a plant,
and an animal-like existence before becoming human
as we are today, and beyond us lie still further evolutions
where we shall approach the Divine more and
more. It will be readily conceded that it is our
animal passions which restrain us upon the path of
attainment; the lower nature is constantly warring
against the higher self. At least in those who have
experienced a spiritual awakening, a war is being
fought silently within, and is all the more bitter for
being suppressed. Goethe with masterly art voiced
that sentiment in the words of Faust, the aspiring
soul, speaking to his more materialistic friend, Wagner:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“Thou by one sole impulse art possessed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Unconscious of the other still remain.</div>
   <div class="verse">Two souls, alas, are housed within my breast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And struggle there for undivided reign.</div>
   <div class="verse">One, to the earth with passionate desire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And closely clinging organs still adheres;</div>
   <div class="verse">Above the mists the other doth aspire</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With sacred ardor unto purer spheres.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was the knowledge of this absolute necessity of
chastity (save when procreation is the object) upon
the part of those who have had a spiritual awakening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
which dictated the words of Christ, and the Apostle
Paul stated an esoteric truth when he said that <em>those
who partook of the Communion without living the
life were in danger of sickness and death</em>. For just as
under a spiritual tutelage, purity of life may elevate
the disciple wonderfully, so also unchastity has a
much stronger effect upon his more sensitized bodies
than upon those who are yet under the law, and have
not became partakers of grace by the cup of the New
Covenant.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Sacrament of Baptism</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Having</span> studied the esoteric significance of our
Christian festivals, such as Christmas and
Easter, and having also studied the doctrine of the
Immaculate Conception, it may be well now to devote
attention to the inner meaning of the sacraments of
the church which are administered to the individual
in all Christian lands from the cradle to the grave,
and are with him at all important points in his life
journey.</p>

<p>As soon as he has entered upon the journey of life,
the church admits him into its fold by the rite of <em>Baptism</em>
which is conferred upon him at a time when he
himself is irresponsible; later, when his mentality has
been somewhat developed, he ratifies that contract
and is admitted to <em>Communion</em>, where <em>bread</em> is broken
and <em>wine</em> is sipped in memory of the Founder of our
faith. Still further upon life’s journey comes the
sacrament of <em>Marriage</em>; and at last when the race has
been run and the spirit again withdraws to God who
gave it, the earth body is consigned to the dust, whence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
it was derived, accompanied by the blessings of the
church.</p>

<p>In our Protestant times the spirit of protest is
rampant in the extreme, and dissenters everywhere
raise their voices in rebellion against the fancied
arrogance of the priesthood and deprecate the sacraments
as mere mummery. On account of that
attitude of mind these functions have become of little
or no effect in the life of the community; dissensions
have arisen even among churchmen themselves, and
sect after sect has divorced itself from the original
apostolic congregation.</p>

<p>Despite all protests the various doctrines and sacraments
of the church are, nevertheless, the very keystones
in the arch of evolution, for they inculcate
morals of the loftiest nature; and even materialistic
scientists, such as Huxley, have admitted that while
self-protection brings about “the survival of the
fittest” in the animal kingdom and is therefore the
basis of animal evolution, self-sacrifice is the fostering
principle of human advancement. When that is
the case among mere mortals, we may well believe
that it must be so to a still greater extent in the Divine
Author of our being.</p>

<p>Among animals might is right, but we recognize
that the weak have a claim to the protection of the
strong. The butterfly lays its eggs on the underside
of a green leaf and goes off without another care for
their well-being. In mammals the <em>mother</em> instinct is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
strongly developed, and we see the lioness caring for
her cubs and ready to defend them with her life; but
not until the human kingdom is reached does the
<em>father</em> commence to share fully in the responsibility
as a parent. Among savages the care of the young practically
ends with attainment of physical ability to care
for themselves, but the higher we ascend in civilization
the longer the young receive care from their parents,
and the more stress is laid upon mental education so
that when maturity has been reached the battle of life
may be fought from the mental rather than from the
physical point of vantage; for the further we proceed
along the path of development the more we shall experience
the power of mind over matter. By the more
and more prolonged self-sacrifice of parents, the race
is becoming more delicate, but what we lose in material
ruggedness we gain in spiritual perceptibility.</p>

<p>As this faculty grows stronger and more developed,
the craving of the spirit immured in this earthly body
voices itself more loudly in a demand for understanding
of the spiritual side of development. Wallace and
Darwin, Huxley and Spencer, pointed out how evolution
of <em>form</em> is accomplished in nature; Ernest
Haeckel attempted to solve the riddle of the universe,
but no one of them could satisfactorily explain away
the <em>Divine Author</em> of what we see. The great goddess,
<em>Natural Selection</em>, is being forsaken by one after another
of her devotees as the years go by. Even Haeckel,
the arch materialist, in his last years showed an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
almost hysterical anxiety to make a place for God in
his system, and the day will come in a not far distant
future when science will have become as thoroughly
religious as religion itself. The church, on the other
hand, though still extremely conservative is nevertheless
slowly abandoning its autocratic dogmatism and
becoming more scientific in its explanations. Thus in
time we shall see the union of science and religion as
it existed in the ancient mystery temples, and when
that point has been reached, <em>the doctrines and sacraments</em>
of the church will be found to <em>rest upon immutable
cosmic laws of no less importance than the
law of gravity</em> which maintains the marching orbs in
their paths around the sun. As the points of the
equinoxes and solstices are turning points in the cyclic
path of a planet, marked by festivals such as Christmas
and Easter, so birth into the physical world, admission
to the church, to the state of matrimony, and
finally the exit from physical life, are points in the
cyclic path of the human spirit around its central
source—God, which are marked by the sacraments of
<em>baptism</em>, <em>communion</em>, <em>marriage</em>, and <em>the last blessing</em>.</p>

<p>We will now consider the rite of baptism. Much has
been said by dissenters, against the practice of taking
an <em>infant into church and promising for it a religious
life</em>. Heated arguments concerning <em>sprinkling versus
plunging</em> have resulted in division of churches. If we
wish to obtain the true idea of baptism, we must revert
to the early history of the human race as recorded in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
the Memory of Nature. All that has ever happened
is indelibly pictured in the ether as a moving picture
is imprinted upon a sensitized film, which picture
can be reproduced upon a screen at any moment.
The pictures in the Memory of Nature may be
viewed by the trained seer, even though millions of
years have elapsed since the scenes there portrayed
were enacted in life.</p>

<p>When we consult that unimpeachable record it appears
that there was a time when that which is now
our earth came out of chaos, dark and unformed, as
the Bible states. The currents developed in this
misty mass by spiritual agencies, generated <em>heat</em>, and
the mass ignited at the time when we are told that God
said, “Let there be light.” The heat of the fiery
mass and the cold space surrounding it generated
<em>moisture</em>; the fire mist became surrounded by water
which boiled, and steam was projected into the atmosphere;
thus “God divided the water ... from
the waters ..<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>.”—the dense water which was
nearest the fire mist from the steam (which is water
in suspension), as stated in the Bible.</p>

<p>When water containing sediment is boiled over and
over it deposits scale, and similarly the water surrounding
our planet finally formed a crust around the
fiery core. The Bible further informs us that a <em>mist</em>
went up from the ground, <em>and we may well conceive</em>
how the moisture was gradually evaporated from our
planet in those early days.</p>

<p>Ancient myths are usually regarded as superstitions
nowadays, but in reality each of them contains a great
spiritual truth in pictorial symbols. These fantastic
stories were given to infant humanity to teach them
moral lessons which their newborn intellects were not
yet fitted to receive. They were taught by myths—much
as we teach our children by picture books and
fables—lessons beyond their intellectual comprehension.</p>

<p>One of the greatest of these folk stories is ”<cite>The
Ring of the Niebelung</cite>”, which tells of a wonderful
treasure hidden under the waters of the Rhine. It
was a lump of gold in its natural state. Placed upon
a high rock, it illuminated the entire submarine
scenery where water nymphs sported about innocently
in gladsome frolic. But one of the Niebelungs, imbued
with greed, stole the treasure, carried it out of
the water, and fled. It was impossible for him, however,
to shape it until he had forsworn love. Then
he fashioned it into a ring which gave him power
over all the treasures of earth, but at the same time
it inaugurated dissension and strife. For its sake,
friend betrayed friend, brother slew brother, and
everywhere it caused oppression, sorrow, sin, and
death, until it was at last restored to the watery element
and the earth was consumed in flames. But
later there arose, like the new phoenix from the ashes
of the old bird, a new heaven and a new earth where
righteousness was re-established.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>That old folk story gives a wonderful picture of
human evolution. The name <i>Niebelungen</i> is derived
from the German words, <i lang="de">nebel</i> (which means mist),
and <i lang="de">ungen</i> (which means children). Thus the word
<i>Niebelungen</i> means <em>children of the mist</em>, and it refers
back to the time when humanity lived in the foggy
atmosphere surrounding our earth at the stage in its
development previously mentioned. There infant humanity
lived in one vast brotherhood, innocent of all
evil as the babe of today, and illuminated by the
Universal Spirit symbolized as the Rhinegold which
shed its light upon the water nymphs of our story.
But in time the earth cooled more and more; the fog
condensed and flooded depressions upon the surface
of the earth with water; the atmosphere cleared; the
eyes of man were opened and he perceived himself as
a separate ego. Then the Universal Spirit of <em>love</em>
and <em>solidarity</em> was superseded by egotism and self-seeking.</p>

<p>That was the rape of the Rhinegold, and sorrow,
sin, strife, treachery, and murder have given place to
the childlike love which existed among humanity in
that primal state when they dwelt in the watery
atmosphere of long ago. Gradually this tendency is
becoming more and more marked, and the curse of
selfishness grows more and more apparent. “Man’s
inhumanity to man” hangs like a funeral pall over
the earth, and must inevitably bring about destruction
of existing conditions. The whole creation is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
groaning and travailing, waiting for the day of redemption,
and the Western Religion strikes the keynote
of the way to attainment when it exhorts us to
love our neighbor as we love ourselves; for then
egotism will be abrogated for universal brotherhood
and love.</p>

<p>Therefore, when a person is admitted to the church,
which is a <em>spiritual</em> institution where love and brotherhood
are the mainsprings of action, it is appropriate
to carry him <em>under the waters</em> of baptism in symbol
of the beautiful condition of childlike innocence and
love which prevailed when mankind dwelt <em>under the
mist</em> in that bygone period. At that time the eyes
of infant man had not yet been opened to the <em>material</em>
advantages of this world. The little child which
is brought into the church has not yet become aware
of the allurements of life either, and others obligate
themselves to guide it to lead a holy life according to
the best of their ability, because experience gained
since the Flood has taught us that the broad way of
the world is strewn with pain, sorrow, and disappointment;
that only by following the straight and narrow
way can we escape death and enter into life everlasting.</p>

<p>Thus we see that there is a wonderfully deep, mystic
significance behind the sacrament of baptism; that it
is to remind us of the blessings attendant upon those
who are members of a <em>brotherhood</em> where self-seeking
is put into the background and where <em>service</em> to others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
is the keynote and mainspring of action. While we
are in the world, he is the greatest who can most successfully
dominate others. In the church we have
Christ’s definition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> “<em>He who would be the greatest
among you, let him be the servant of all.</em>”</p>

<span class="smcap">The Sacrament of Marriage</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">When stripped</span> of nonessentials the argument
of the orthodox Christian religion may be
said to be as follows:</p>

<p>First, that tempted by the devil, our first parents
sinned and were exiled from their previous state of
celestial bliss, placed under the law, made subject to
death, and became incapable of escaping by their own
efforts.</p>

<p>Second, that God so loved the world that He gave
Christ, His only begotten Son, for its redemption and
to establish the kingdom of heaven. Thus death will
finally be swallowed up in immortality.</p>

<p>This simple creed has provoked the smiles of
atheists, and of the purely intellectual who have
studied transcendental philosophies with their niceties
of logic and argument; and even of some among those
who study the Western Mystery Teaching.</p>

<p>Such an attitude of mind is entirely gratuitous.
We might know that the divine leaders of mankind
would not allow millions to continue in error for mil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>lennia.
When the Western Mystery Teaching is
stripped of its exceedingly illuminating explanations
and detailed descriptions, when its basic teachings are
stated, they are found to be in exact agreement with
the orthodox Christian teachings.</p>

<p>There was a time when mankind lived in a sinless
state; when sorrow, pain, and death were unknown.
Neither is the <em>personal tempter</em> of Christianity a myth,
for the Lucifer spirits may very well be said to be
fallen angels, and their temptation of man resulted
in focusing his consciousness upon the material phase
of existence where he is under the law of decrepitude
and death. Also it is truly the mission of Christ to aid
mankind by elevating them to a more ethereal state
where dissolution will no longer be necessary to free
them from vehicles that have grown too hard and set
for further use. For this is indeed a “body of death,”
where only the smallest quantity of material is really
alive, as part of its bulk is nutrient matter that has
not yet been assimilated, another large part is already
on its way to elimination, and only between these two
poles may be found the material which is thoroughly
quickened by the spirit.</p>

<p>We have in other chapters considered the sacraments
of baptism and communion, sacraments that
have to do particularly with the spirit. We will now
seek to understand the deeper side of the sacrament
of marriage, which has to do particularly with the
body. Like the other sacraments the institution of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
marriage had its beginning and will also have its end.
The commencement was described by the Christ when
He said, “Have ye not read that He which made them
at the beginning made them male and female, and
said: For this cause shall a man leave father
and mother and cleave to his wife; and they
twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no
more twain, but one flesh.” Matt. 19:4-6. He also
indicated the end of marriage when he said: “In the
resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage,
but are as the angels of God in heaven.” Matt.
22:30.</p>

<p>In this light the logic of the teaching is apparent,
for <em>marriage</em> became necessary in order that <em>birth</em>
might provide new instruments to take the place of
those which had been ruptured by <em>death</em>; and when
death has once been swallowed up in immortality and
there is no need of providing new instruments, marriage
also will be unnecessary.</p>

<p>Science with admirable audacity has sought to solve
the mystery of fecundation, and has told us how
invagination takes place in the walls of the ovary;
how the little ovum is formed in the seclusion of its
dark cavity; how it emerges therefrom and enters the
Fallopian tube; is pierced by the spermatozoon of the
male, and the nucleus of a human body is complete.
We are thus supposed to be “at the fount and origin
of life!” But life has neither beginning nor end, and
what science mistakenly considers the fountain of life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
is really the source of death, as all that comes from
the womb is destined sooner or later to reach the tomb.
The <em>marriage</em> feast which prepares for <em>birth</em>, at the
same time provides food for the insatiable jaws of
<em>death</em>, and so long as marriage is necessary to generation
and birth, disintegration and death must inevitably
result. Therefore it is of prime importance to
know the history of marriage, the laws and agencies
involved, the duration of this institution, and how it
may be transcended.</p>

<p>When we obtained our vital bodies in Hyperborea,
the sun, moon, and earth were still united, and the
solar-lunar forces permeated each being in even measure
so that all were able to perpetuate their kind by
buds and spores as do certain plants of today. The
efforts of the vital body to soften the dense vehicle
and keep it alive were not then interfered with, and
these primal, plantlike bodies lived for ages. But man
was then unconscious and stationary like a plant; he
made no effort or exertion. The addition of a desire
body furnished incentive and desire, and consciousness
resulted from the war between the vital body,
which builds, and the desire body, which destroys the
dense body.</p>

<p>Thus dissolution became only a question of time,
particularly as the constructive energy of the vital
body was also necessarily divided, one part or pole
being used in the vital functions of the body, the other
to replace a vehicle lost by death. But as the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
poles of a magnet or dynamo are requisite to manifestation,
so also two single-sexed beings became necessary
for generation; thus marriage and birth were
necessarily inaugurated to offset the effect of death.
<em>Death, then, is the price we pay for consciousness in
the present world</em>; marriage and repeated births are
our weapons against the king of terrors until our
constitution shall change and we become as angels.</p>

<p>Please mark that it is not stated that we are to become
angels, but that we are to become <em>as angels</em>. For
the angels are the humanity of the Moon Period; they
belong to an entirely different stream of evolution, as
different as are human spirits from those of our present
animals. Paul states in his letter to the Hebrews
that man was made <em>for a little while</em> inferior to the
angels; he descended lower into the scale of materiality
during the Earth Period, while the angels have
never inhabited a globe denser than ether. As we
build our bodies from the chemical constituents of the
earth, so do the angels build theirs of ether. This substance
is the direct avenue of all life forces, and when
man has once become as the angels and has learned to
build his body of ether, naturally there will be no
death and no need of marriage to bring about birth.</p>

<p>But looking at marriage from another point of
view, looking upon it as a union of souls rather than
as a union of the sexes, we contact the wonderful mystery
of Love. Union of the sexes might serve to perpetuate
the race, of course, but the true marriage is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
companionship of souls also, which altogether transcends
sex. Yet those really able to meet upon that
lofty plane of spiritual intimacy gladly offer their
bodies as living sacrifices upon the altar of <em>Love of
the Unborn</em>, to woo a waiting spirit into an immaculately
conceived body. Thus humanity may be saved
from the reign of death.</p>

<p>This is readily apparent as soon as we consider the
gentle action of the vital body and contrast it with
that of the desire body in a fit of temper, where it is
said that a man has “lost control” of himself. Under
such conditions the muscles become tense, and nervous
energy is expended at a suicidal rate, so that after
such an outbreak the body may sometimes be prostrated
for weeks. The hardest labor brings no such
fatigue as a fit of temper; likewise a child conceived
in passion under the crystallizing tendencies of the
desire nature is naturally short-lived, and it is a regrettable
fact that <em>length of life</em> is nowadays almost a
misnomer; in view of the appalling infant mortality
it ought to be called <em>brevity of existence</em>.</p>

<p>The building tendencies of the vital body, which is
the vehicle of love, are not so easily watched, but observation
proves that contentment lengthens the life
of any one who cultivates this quality, and we may
safely reason that a child conceived under conditions
of harmony and love stands a better chance of life
than one conceived under conditions of anger, inebriety,
and passion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>According to Genesis it was said to the woman,
“In sorrow shalt thou bear children,” and it has always
been a sore puzzle to Bible commentators what
logical connection there may be between the eating of
fruit and the pains of parturition. But when we
understand the chaste references of the Bible to the
act of generation, the connection is readily perceived.
While the insensitive Negro or Indian mother may
bear her child and shortly afterward resume her
labors in the field, the western woman, more acutely
sensitive and of high-strung nervous temperament, is
year by year finding it more difficult to go through
the ordeal of motherhood, though aided by the best
and most skilled scientific help.</p>

<p>The contributory reasons are various: In the first
place, while we are exceedingly careful in selecting
our horses and cattle for breeding, while we insist
upon pedigree for the animals in order that we may
bring out the very best strain of stock upon our farms,
we exercise no such care with respect to the selection
of a father or mother for our children. We mate upon
impulse and regret it at our leisure, aided by laws
which make it all too easy to enter or leave the sacred
bonds of matrimony. The words pronounced by minister
or judge are taken to be a license for unlimited
indulgence, as if any man-made law could license the
contravention of the law of God. While animals mate
only at a certain time of the year and the mother is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
undisturbed during the period of pregnancy, this is
not true of the human race.</p>

<p>In view of these facts is it to be wondered at that
we find such a dread of maternity, and is it not time
that we seek to remedy the matter by a more sane relation
between marriage partners? Astrology will reveal
the temper and tendencies of each human being; it
will enable two people to blend their characters in
such a manner that a love life may be lived, and it
will indicate the periods when interplanetary lines of
force are most nearly conducive to painless parturition.
Thus it will enable us to draw from the bosom
of nature, children of love, capable of living long lives
in good health. Finally the day will come when these
bodies will have been made so perfect in their ethereal
purity that they may last throughout the coming Age,
and thus make marriage superfluous.</p>

<p>But if we can love now when we see one another
“through a glass darkly,” through the mask of personality
and the veil of misunderstanding, we may
be sure that the love of soul for soul, purged of passion
in the furnace of sorrow, will be our brightest
gem in heaven as its shadow is on earth.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Some of our</span> students have been exercised about
the unpardonable sin, and as this subject has a
certain connection with the subject of marriage, one
being a sacrilege and the other a sacrament, it might
be well to elucidate the matter from a different point
of view than has been formerly taken in our literature.</p>

<p>First let us see what is meant by a sacrament, and
why the rites of baptism, communion, marriage, and
extreme unction are properly so called; then we shall
be in a position to understand what sacrilege is and
why it is unpardonable.</p>

<p>The Rosicrucians teach, only with more detail, the
same doctrine that Paul preached in the 15th chapter
of 1st Corinthians, starting at the thirty-fifth verse,
that in addition to the body of flesh and blood we
have a soul body, <i>soma psuchicon</i>, (mistranslated
“natural” body), and a spiritual body; that each of
these bodies is grown from a different <em>seed</em> atom and
that there are <em>three</em> stages of unfoldment for Adam,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
or man. The first Adam was taken from the ground
and was without sentient life. Soul was added to the
<em>second Adam</em>; thus he had life within, a leaven laboring
to elevate the clod to God. When the potential of
the soul extracted from the physical body has been
raised to the spiritual, the <em>last Adam</em> will become a
life <em>giving</em> spirit, capable of transmitting the life impulse
to others directly as flame from one candle can
be communicated to many without diminishing the
magnitude of the original light.</p>

<p>In the meantime the germ for our earthly body had
to be properly placed in fruitful soil to grow a suitable
vehicle, and generative organs were provided
from the beginning to accomplish this purpose. It is
stated in Genesis 1:27, that Elohim created them <em>male</em>
and <em>female</em>. The Hebrew words are “<i lang="he">sacre va
n’cabah</i>.” <em>These are names of the sex organs.</em> Literally
translated, <i lang="he">sacr</i> means “bearer of the germ.” Thus
marriage is a <i lang="he">sacr</i>-ament, for it opens the way for
transmission of a physical seed atom from the father
to the mother, and tends to preserve the race against
the ravages of death. Baptism as a <i lang="he">Sacr</i>ament signifies
the germinal urge of the soul for the higher life.
Holy Communion, in which we partake of bread
(made from the <em>seed</em> of chaste plants), and of wine
(the cup symbolizing the passionless <em>seed</em>-pod), points
to the age to come, an age wherein it will be unnecessary
to <em>transmit</em> the seed through a father and mother,
but where we may feed directly upon cosmic life and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
thus conquer death. Finally, extreme unction is the
<i lang="he">sacr</i>ament which marks the loosening of the silver
cord, and the extraction of the sacred germ, freeing
it until it shall again be planted in another <i lang="he">n’cabah</i>,
or mother.</p>

<p>As the seed and ovum are the root and basis of
racial development, it is easy to see that no sin can be
more serious than that which abuses the creative
function, for by that <i lang="he">sacr</i>-ilege we stunt future generations
and transgress against the Holy Spirit, Jehovah,
who is warder of the creative lunar forces. His angels
herald births, as in the cases of Isaac, John the Baptist,
and Jesus. When he wanted to reward his most
faithful follower, he promised to make his seed as
numerous as the sands on the seashore. He also
meted out a most terrible punishment to the Sodomites
who committed <i lang="he">sacr</i>-ilege by misdirecting the
seed. He even visits the sins of the fathers upon the
children to the third and fourth generations, for
under his regime <em>Law</em> reigns supreme. Man has not
yet evolved to the point where he can respond to <em>love</em>.
He requires from his enemies an eye for an eye, and
with the same measure that he metes, it is meted unto
him.</p>

<p>Though this seems very cruel to us who are each
day evolving more and more the faculties of love and
mercy, we must remember that this retributive justice
relates purely to the physical body, which is
under the laws of Nature just as much as any other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
chemical composition in the universe. When abuses
have weakened it, it is incapable of fulfilling its mission
and meeting our demands in any respect, just as
is the case with any other machinery which we have
made from the materials around us. There are no
miracles such as would be required to generate a
sound and healthy body from parents who have transgressed
the laws of nature by their abuses; therefore
that sin cannot be remitted but must be expiated;
but when time and care have restored the necessary
strength and vigor, the body will again perform its
functions in a normal and healthy manner.</p>

<p>Thus we understand that under the law there is no
mercy, for mercy is dictated by love. Therefore it
was perfectly in consonance with cosmic order when
<em>Christ, the Lord of Love</em>, said that all things would
be forgiven to men which they did against Him, as
<em>love</em> is the reigning feature in His kingdom; but whatsoever
was done contrary to the <em>law</em> of Jehovah must
meet its full retribution. We cannot be sufficiently
thankful for the wonderful religion which He gave
us, particularly if we compare it with those under
which less evolved peoples are now struggling. Take
the Buddhists, for instance: grand and beautiful
though their leader was, he saw only <em>sorrow</em>, a constant
struggle against the laws of nature. He aimed
to teach his followers to transcend that condition by
perfect obedience such as that whereby we have conquered
the laws of electricity and other forces in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
nature. The Buddhist sees nothing but the cold and
merciless law; on the other hand, we of the Western
World have before our eyes from the cradle to the
grave a beautiful picture of One who said, “Come
unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and
I will give you rest.”</p>

<p>But it may be asked, “What about <em>lost souls</em>; are
they a figment of the imagination also?” To this question
may be answered, “yes,” although it needs some
qualification. We shall best understand the case if
we go back into the history of mankind and view the
experiences of some who have transgressed, for they
will furnish us an example of what may happen. In
order to establish the point properly we shall reiterate
a few of the Rosicrucian teachings regarding the
genesis of the earth and of man upon it. Three great
stages of unfoldment have preceded the present Earth
Period. <em>The Father</em> is the highest Initiate of the Saturn
Period, inhabiting particularly the Spiritual Sun.
<em>The Son</em>, the cosmic Christ, is the highest Initiate of
the Sun Period, inhabiting the Central Sun and guiding
the planets in their orbits by a ray from Himself,
which becomes the indwelling spirit of each planet
when it has been sufficiently ripened to contain such
a great Intelligence. Jehovah, the <em>Holy Spirit</em>, is the
highest Initiate of the Moon Period and dwelling in
the physical, visible sun. He is regent of the various
moons thrown off by the different planets for the
purpose of giving beings who have fallen behind in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
the march of evolution more rigid discipline under a
firmer law, to awaken them and spur them on in the
proper direction if possible.</p>

<p>When we look into space, we perceive that some
planets have a number of moons and others have none;
but as there are laggards in any large company, and
as moons are required to aid these stragglers to retrieve
their lost estate if possible, we may be sure that
these planets which have no moons now have had
them in the past. Those Great Beings of whom the
<cite>Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception</cite> speaks as “Lords of
Venus” and “Lords of Mercury” were, in fact,
stragglers from those two planets. In the dim distant
past they inhabited moons which encircled their
respective planets, and were successful in retrieving
their loss in a large measure under the discipline
given them there. Later they received the opportunity
to serve the humanity of our earth, and by that
service to secure a return to the home planet whence
they had been exiled. They were <em>lost</em> under the <em>law</em>,
but <em>redeemed by love</em>; and thus we may infer that
opportunities for service will also bring to other beings,
who may become “lost,” the opportunity to retrieve
the past.</p>

<p>Since it may puzzle the student as to what becomes
of the moons upon which such beings dwell for a time,
we may say that the solar system is to be regarded as
the body of the Great Spirit whom we call God, and as
any growth caused by an abnormal process pains us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
when it occurs in our body, so also such crystallizations
as moons are sources of discomfort to that Great Being.
Furthermore, as our own systems endeavor to
eliminate such abnormalities as growths, so also the
universe endeavors to expel moons which have served
their purpose. While the beings who have been
exiled to a moon are there, the Planetary Spirit of the
primary planet by his care for these beings, holds the
moon in its orbit, and we speak of his love for them
as the Law of Attraction; but when they have returned
to the parent planet, the Planetary Spirit has
no further interest in their cinder-like habitation.
Then slowly the orbit of the vacated moon widens, it
commences to disintegrate, and it is finally expelled
into interstellar space. The asteroids are remnants
of moons which once encircled Venus and Mercury.
There are also other seeming moons and lunar fragments
in our solar system, but the <cite>Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception</cite>
does not concern itself with them as they
are outside the pale of evolution.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Immaculate Conception</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The periodical</span> ebb and flow of the material
and spiritual forces which invest the earth are
the invisible causes of the physical, moral, and mental
activities upon our globe.</p>

<p>According to the hermetic axiom, “As above so
below,” a similar activity must take place in man,
who is but a minor edition of Mother Nature.</p>

<p>The animals have twenty-eight pairs of spinal
nerves and are now in their Moon stage, perfectly attuned
to the twenty-eight days in which the moon
passes around the zodiac. In their wild state the group
spirit regulates their mating. Therefore there is no
overflow with them. Man, on the other hand, is in a
transition stage; he is too far progressed for the lunar
vibrations for he has thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves.
But he is not yet attuned to the solar month of thirty-one
days, and he mates at all times of the year; hence
the periodical flow in woman, which under proper
conditions is utilized to form part of the body of a
child more perfect than its parent. Similarly, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
periodical flow in mankind becomes the sinew and
backbone of racial advancement; and the periodical
flow of the earth’s spiritual forces, which occurs at
Christmas, results in the birth of Saviors who from
time to time give renewed impetus to the spiritual
advancement of the human race.</p>

<p>There are two parts to our Bible, the Old and the
New Testaments. After briefly reciting how the
world came into being, the former tells the story of the
“Fall.” In view of what has been written in our
literature we understand the Fall to have been occasioned
by man’s impulsive and ignorant use of the
sex forces at times when the interplanetary rays were
inimical to conception of the purest and best vehicles.
Thus man became gradually imprisoned in a dense
body crystallized by sinful passion and consequently
an imperfect vehicle, subject to pain and death.</p>

<p>Then commenced the pilgrimage through matter,
and for millennia we have been living in this hard
and flinty shell of body, which obscures the light of
heaven from the spirit within. The spirit is like a
diamond in its rough coat, and the celestial lapidaries,
the Recording Angels, are constantly endeavoring to
remove the coating so that the spirit may shine
through the vehicle which it ensouls.</p>

<p>When the lapidary holds the diamond to the grindstone,
the diamond emits a screech like a cry of pain
as the opaque covering is removed; but gradually by
many successive applications to the grindstone the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
rough diamond may become a gem of transcendent
beauty and purity. Similarly, the celestial beings in
charge of our evolution hold us closely to the grindstone
of experience. Pain and suffering result, which
awaken the spirit sleeping within. The man hitherto
content with material pursuits, indulgent of sense and
sex, becomes imbued with a divine discontent which
impels him to seek the higher life.</p>

<p>The gratification of that aspiration, however, is
not usually accomplished without a severe struggle
upon the part of the lower nature. It was while
wrestling thus that Paul exclaimed with all the
anguish of a devout, aspiring heart: “Oh wretched
man that I am * * * The good that I would,
I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do
* * * I delight in the law of God after the inward
man; but I see another law in my members warring
against the law of my mind and bringing it into
captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.”
(Rom. 7:19-24.)</p>

<p>When the flower is crushed, its scent is liberated
and fills the surroundings with grateful fragrance, delighting
all who are fortunate enough to be near.
Crushing blows of fate may overwhelm a man or
woman who has reached the stage of efflorescence;
they will but serve to bring out the sweetness of the
nature and enhance the beauty of the soul till it shines
with an effulgence that marks the wearer as with a
halo. Then he is upon the path of Initiation. He is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
taught how unbridled use of sex regardless of the
stellar rays has imprisoned him in the body, how it
fetters him, and how by the proper use of that same
force in harmony with the stars he may gradually improve
and etherealize his body and finally attain
liberation from concrete existence.</p>

<p>A shipwright cannot build a staunch oak ship from
spruce lumber; “men do not gather grapes of thorns;”
like always begets like, and an incoming ego of a passionate
nature is drawn to parents of like nature,
where its body is conceived upon the impulse of the
moment in a gust of passion.</p>

<p>The soul who has tasted the cup of sorrow incident
to the abuse of the creative force and has drunk to
the dregs the bitterness thereof, will gradually seek
parents of less and less passionate natures, until at
length it attains to Initiation.</p>

<p>Having been taught in the process of Initiation the
influence of the stellar rays upon parturition, the
next body provided will be generated by Initiate parents
without passion, under the constellation most
favorable to the work which the ego contemplates.
Therefore the Gospels (which are formulae of Initiation)
commence with the account of the immaculate
conception and end with the crucifixion, both wonderful
ideals to which we must some time attain, for
each of us is a Christ-in-the-making, and will sometime
pass through both the mystic birth and the mystic
death adumbrated in the Gospels. By knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
we may hasten the day, intelligently co-operating instead
of as now often stupidly frustrating through
ignorance the ends of spiritual development.</p>

<p>In connection with the immaculate conception misunderstandings
prevail at every point; the perpetual
virginity of the mother even after giving birth to
other children; the lowly station of Joseph, the supposed
foster-father, etc. We will briefly view them in
the light of facts as revealed in the Memory of Nature:</p>

<p>In some parts of Europe people of the higher classes
are addressed as “wellborn,” or even as “highwellborn,”
meaning that they are the offspring of cultured
parents in high station. Such people usually
look down with scorn upon those in modest positions.
We have nothing against the expression “wellborn;”
we would that every child were well born, born to
parents of high moral standing no matter what their
station in life. There is a virginity of soul that is independent
of the state of the body, a purity of mind
which will carry its possessor through the act of generation
without the taint of passion and enable the
mother to carry the unborn child under her heart in
sexless love.</p>

<p>Previous to the time of Christ that would have
been impossible. In the earlier stages of man’s career
upon earth quantity was desirable and quality a minor
consideration, hence the command was given to “go
forth, be fruitful, and multiply.” Besides, it was
necessary that man should temporarily forget his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
spiritual nature and concentrate his energies upon
material conditions. Indulgence of the sex passion
furthers that object, and the desire nature was given
full sway. Polygamy flourished, and the larger the
number of their children, the more a man and a
woman were honored, while barrenness was looked
upon as the greatest possible affliction.</p>

<p>In other directions the desire nature was being
curbed by God-given laws, and obedience to divine
commands was enforced by swift punishment of the
transgressor, such as war, pestilence or famine. Rewards
for dutiful observance of the mandates of the
law were not wanting either; the “righteous” man’s
children, his cattle and crops were numerous; he was
victorious over his enemies and the cup of his happiness
was full.</p>

<p>Later when the earth had been sufficiently peopled
after the Atlantean Flood, polygamy became gradually
more and more obsolete, with the result that the
quality of the bodies improved, and at the time of
Christ the desire nature had become so far amenable
to control in the case of the more advanced among
humanity that the act of generation could be performed
without passion, out of pure love, so that the
child could be immaculately conceived.</p>

<p>Such were the parents of Jesus. Joseph is said to
have been a carpenter, but he was not a worker in
wood. He was a “builder” in a higher sense. God is
the Grand Architect of the universe. Under Him are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
many builders of varying degrees of spiritual splendor,
down even to those whom we know as Freemasons. All
are engaged in building a temple without sound of
hammer, and Joseph was no exception.</p>

<p>It is sometimes asked why Initiates are always men.
They are not; in the lower degrees there are many
women, but when an Initiate is able to choose his sex
he usually takes the positive masculine body, as the life
which brought him to Initiation has spiritualized his
vital body and made it positive under all conditions,
so that he has then an instrument of the highest
efficiency.</p>

<p>There are times, however, when the exigencies of a
case require a female body, such as, for instance, providing
a body of the highest type to receive an ego
of superlatively high degree. Then a high Initiate
may take a female body and go through the experience
of maternity again, after perhaps having eschewed it
for several lives, as was the case with the beautiful
character we know as Mary of Bethlehem.</p>

<p>In conclusion, then, let us remember the points
brought out, that we are all Christs-in-the-making; that
sometime we must cultivate characters so spotless that
we may be worthy to inhabit bodies that are immaculately
conceived; and the sooner we commence to
purify our minds of passionate thoughts, the sooner
we shall attain. In the final analysis it only depends
upon the earnestness of our purpose, the strength of
our wills. Conditions are such now that we can live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
pure lives whether married or single, and cold; sister-and-brother
relationships are not necessary either.</p>

<p>Is the life of absolute purity beyond some of us yet?
Be not discouraged; Rome was not built in a day.
Keep on aspiring though you fail again and again,
for the only real failure consists in ceasing to try.</p>

<p>So may God strengthen your aspirations to purity.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Coming Christ</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We have</span> previously seen how infant humanity
in Atlantis lived in unity under direct guidance
of divine leaders, and how they were eventually
brought out of the water into a clear atmosphere
where the separateness of each individual from all
others became obvious at once.</p>

<p>“God is Light”—the Light which became life in
man. It was dim and achromatically diffused in the
misty atmosphere of early Atlantis, as colorless as the
air on a densely foggy day in the present age, hence
the unity of all beings who lived in that light. But
when man rose above the waters, when he emerged
into the air where the godly manifestation, Light, was
refracted in multitudinous hues, this variously colored
light was differently absorbed by each. Thus diversity
was inaugurated, when mankind went through the
mighty arch of the rainbow with its variegated and
beautiful colors. That bow may therefore be considered
an entrance gate to “the promised land,” the
world as now constituted. Here the light of God is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
no longer an insipid single tint as in early Atlantis.
The present dazzling play of color tells us that <em>the
watchword of the present age is segregation</em>, and
therefore so long as we remain in the present condition
under the law of alternating cycles, where summer
and winter, ebb and flow, succeed each other in
unbroken sequence, so long as God’s bow stands in
the sky, an emblem of diversity, it is yet the day of
the kingdoms of men, and the kingdom of God is
held in abeyance.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as surely as the Edenic conditions
upon the fire girt islands of ancient Lemuria ended in
separation into sexes, each expressing one element of
the creative fire, and making the union of man and
woman as necessary to the generation of a body as is
the union of hydrogen and oxygen to the production
of water; and as surely as emergence from the watery
atmosphere of Atlantis into the airy environment of
<i>Aryana</i>, the world of today, promoted further segregation
into separate nations and individuals, who war
and prey upon one another (because the sharply differentiated
forms which they behold blind them to the
inalienable unity of each soul with all others); just
as certainly will this world condition give place to a
“new heaven and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
righteousness.”</p>

<p>In early Atlantis we lived in the deepest basins of
the earth where the mist was densest; we breathed by
means of gills and would have been unable to live in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
an atmosphere such as we have now. In the course of
time desire to explore beyond caused the invention of
airships, which were propelled by the expansive force
of sprouting grain. The “ark” story is a perverted
remembrance of that fact. Those ships actually did
founder upon mountain tops where the atmosphere
was too rare to sustain them. Today our ships float
upon the element in which the Atlantean ships were
at one time immersed. We have now contrived various
means of propulsion able to carry us over the highlands
of the earth which we occupy at present, and are
commencing to reach out into the atmosphere to conquer
that element as we have subjected the waters;
and as surely as our Atlantean ancestors made a highway
of the watery element which they breathed <em>and
then rose above it to live in a new element</em>, just as
certainly shall we conquer the air and then rise above
it into the newly discovered element which we call
ether.</p>

<p>Thus each age has its own peculiar conditions and
laws; the beings who evolve have a physiological constitution
suited to the environment of that age, but
are dominated by the nature forces then prevailing
until they learn to conform to them. Then these
forces become most valuable servants, as for instance,
steam and electricity, which we have partially harnessed.
The law of gravity still holds us in its powerful
grip, although by mechanical means we are trying
to escape into the new element. We shall at a not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
distant time attain to mastery of the air, but as the
ships of the Atlanteans foundered upon the mountains
of the earth because their buoyancy was insufficient
to enable them to rise higher in the light mist
of those altitudes, and because respiration was difficult,
so also will the increasing rarity of our present
atmosphere prevent us from entering the “new heaven
and the new earth,” which are to be the scene of the
New Dispensation.</p>

<p>Before we can reach that state, physiological as
well as moral and spiritual changes must take place.
The Greek text of the New Testament does not leave
us in doubt as to this, though lack of knowledge of
the mystery teachings prevented the translators from
bringing it out in the English version. Did we but
believe the Bible even as we have it, we should be
spared many delusions and much uneasiness concerning
the time of this. Whole sects have disposed of
their belongings in anticipation of the advent of Christ
on a certain day, and have suffered untold privations
afterwards. Schemers have passed themselves off as
Christ or even as God, have married, raised families,
and died, leaving their sons, who were supposed to be
Christs, to fight for the kingdom. A temporal government
was forced to banish one of these militant
“Christs” to an island of the Mediterranean, and
another to an Asiatic city where he is now under military
supervision. Nor is there any sign that the fu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>ture
will lack similar claimants; rather, the sacrilegious
imposture is spreading.</p>

<p><em>We may rest assured that the divine leaders of
evolution made no mistake when they gave the Christian
Religion to the Western World—the most advanced
teaching to the most precocious among mankind.</em>
It may therefore be regarded as a detriment
when an organization undertakes to graft a Hindu
religion (which is excellent for the people to whom
it was divinely given) upon our people. The imported
Hindu breathing exercises have certainly sent many
people to insane asylums.</p>

<p>If we believe Christ’s words: “My kingdom is not
of this world,” (<i lang="el">kosmos</i>, the Greek word used for
“world” meaning “order of things” rather than our
planet, the earth, which is called <i>gee</i>,) we shall know
better than to look for Christ today.</p>

<p>“Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
God” any more than the gill breathing creature of
early Atlantean times was fit to live under the natural
conditions prevailing in the present age where “the
kingdom of men” exists. Paul, in discussing the
resurrection, does not say as in the English translation,
“There is a natural body and there is a spiritual
body.” I Cor. 15:44. He affirms that there is a
“<i>soma psuchicon</i>,” a soul body, and tells in the preceding
verses how this is generated from a “<em>seed</em>” in
the same way as explained in the Rosicrucian teachings.
The Bible affirms that our bodies are corrupt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>ible.
(It also teaches that one organ, the heart, is an
exception. This has reference to the seed atom in the
heart. Ps. 22:26.) Therefore our bodies must be
changed before Christ can come.</p>

<p>If these things were believed, few would run after
impostors, and the latter would have their labors for
their pains. But Western papers unfortunately give
notoriety to such schemers, though regarding them
as a joke as well they may, for it would be preposterous
to believe that the great and wise Being
who guides evolution could be so shortsighted as not
to know that the Western World would never accept
the scion of what it regards as a semi-barbaric race
for its Savior.</p>

<p>When preparations were made 2000 years ago, for
the embodiment of the Savior of the world, Galilee
was the Mecca for roving spirits. Thither flocked
people from Asia, Africa, Greece, Italy, and all other
parts of the world of that day. Conditions there were
exceptionally congenial and attractive so that, as declared
by various scholars who have investigated the
matter, Galilee was as cosmopolitan as Rome itself.
It was, in fact, the “melting pot” of that day. Among
others, Joseph and Mary, the parents of Jesus, had
emigrated from Judea to Nazareth in Galilee before
the advent of their firstborn, and the body generated
in that environment was different from the ordinary
Jewish race body.</p>

<p>It is an incontrovertible fact that environment plays<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
a great part in evolution. We have today upon earth
<em>three great races</em>. One, the Negro, has hair which is
<em>flat</em> in section, and the head is long, narrow, and
<em>flattened</em> on the sides. The orbit of the eye is also
long and narrow. The Negroes are descendants of
the Lemurian Race.</p>

<p>The Mongols and kindred peoples have <em>round</em> heads.
Their hair is round in section, and the orbits of their
eyes are also round. They are the remnants of the
Atlantean Race.</p>

<p>The <em>Aryan Race</em> have oval hair, oval skulls, and
oval orbits of the eyes, these features being especially
pronounced in the Anglo-Saxons, who are the flower
of the race at present.</p>

<p>In America, the Mecca of nations today, these
various races are of course represented. Here is the
“melting pot” in which they are being amalgamated.
It has been ascertained that here there is a difference
in children belonging to the same family. The <em>skulls
of younger children born in America are more nearly
oval than the heads of their older brothers and sisters
born abroad</em>.</p>

<p>From this fact and from others which need not be
mentioned here, it is evident that a new race is being
born on the American continent; and reasoning from
the known fact that the Christ came from the most
cosmopolitan part of the civilized world of 2000
years ago, it would be but logical to expect that if a
new embodiment were sought for that exalted Being,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
His body would more likely be taken from the new
race than from an ancient one. Otherwise, if
there is virtue in obtaining a Savior from the older
races, why not get a Bushman or a Hottentot?</p>

<p>But we may be sure that though impostors deceive
for a time, they are found out sooner or later, and
their plans come to naught. Meanwhile, progression
continues to bring us nearer the Aquarian Age, and
<em>a Teacher is coming</em> to give the Christian Religion
impetus in a new direction.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Coming Age</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">When we</span> speak of the “Coming Age,” of the
“New Heaven and the New Earth” mentioned
in the Bible, and also of the “Aquarian Age,” the
differences may not be quite clear in the minds of
our students. Confusion of terms is one of the most
fertile seed grounds of fallacy, and the Rosicrucian
teachings aim to avoid it by a particularly definite
nomenclature. Sometimes an extra effort seems necessary
to disperse the haze engendered by current
cloudy conceptions of others as sincere as the present
writer, but not so fortunate in having access to the
incomparable Western Wisdom Teachings.</p>

<p>It has been taught in our literature that four great
epochs of unfoldment preceded the present order of
things; that the density of the earth, its atmospheric
conditions, and the laws of nature prevailing in one
epoch were as different from those of the other epochs
as was the corresponding physiological constitution
of mankind in one epoch different from those in the
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>The bodies of ADM (the name means <em>red earth</em>),
the humanity of fiery Lemuria, were formed of the
“dust of the ground,” the red, hot, volcanic mud,
and were just suited to their environment. Flesh and
blood would have shriveled up in the terrible heat of
that day, and though suited to present conditions,
Paul tells us that they cannot inherit the Kingdom
of God. It is therefore manifest that before a new
order of things can be inaugurated, the physiological
constitution of mankind must be radically changed, to
say nothing of the spiritual attitude. Aeons will be
required to regenerate the whole human race and fit
them to live in ethereal bodies.</p>

<p>On the other hand, neither does a new environment
come into existence in a moment, but land and people
are evolved together from the smallest and most primitive
beginnings. When the mists of Atlantis commenced
to settle, some of our forbears had grown
embryonic lungs and were forced to the highlands
ages before their compeers. They wandered in “the
wilderness” while “the promised land” was emerging
from the lighter fogs, and at the same time their
growing lungs were fitting them to live under present
atmospheric conditions.</p>

<p>Two more races were born in the basins of the earth
before a succession of floods drove them to the highlands:
the last flood took place at the time when the
sun entered the watery sign Cancer, about ten thousand
years ago as told Plato by the Egyptian priests.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
Thus we see there is <em>no sudden</em> change of constitution
or environment for the whole human race when a new
epoch is ushered in, but an overlapping of conditions
which makes it possible for most of the race by
gradual adjustment to enter the new condition, though
the change may seem sudden to the individual when
the preparatory change has been accomplished unconsciously.
The metamorphosis of a tadpole from a
denizen of the watery element to one of the airy
gives an analogy of the past, and the transformation
of the earthworm to a butterfly soaring in the air is an
apt simile of the coming age. When the heavenly
time marker came into Aries by precession, a new
cycle commenced, and the “glad tidings” were
preached by Christ. He said by implication that the
new heaven and earth were not ready then when He
told His disciples: Whither I go you cannot <em>now</em> follow,
but you shall follow afterwards. I go to prepare
a place for you and will come again and receive you.</p>

<p>Later John saw in a vision the new Jerusalem
descending from heaven, and Paul taught the Thessalonians
“<em>by the word of the Lord</em>” that those who
are Christs at His coming shall be caught up <em>in the
air</em> to meet Him and be with Him <em>for the age</em>.</p>

<p>But during this change there are pioneers who enter
the kingdom of God before their brethren. Christ, in
Matt. 11:12, said that “the kingdom of heaven suffereth
violence, and the violent take it by force.”
This is not a correct translation. It ought to be: The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
kingdom of the heavens <em>has been invaded</em> (<i lang="el">biaxetai</i>),
and invaders seize on her. Men and women have already
learned through holy, helpful lives to lay aside
the body of flesh and blood, either intermittently or
permanently, and to walk the skies with winged feet,
intent upon the business of their Lord, clad in the
ethereal “wedding garment” of the new dispensation.
This change may be accomplished through a life of
simple helpfulness and prayer as practiced by devoted
Christians, no matter with what church they affiliate,
as well as by the specific exercises given in the Rosicrucian
Fellowship. The latter will prove barren of
results, unless accompanied by constant <em>acts</em> of love
for <em>love</em> will be the keynote of the coming age as <em>Law</em>
is of the present order. The intense expression of the
former quality increases the phosphorescent luminosity
and density of the ethers in our vital bodies, the
fiery streams sever the tie to the mortal coil, and the
man, once <em>born of water</em> upon his emergence from
Atlantis, is now born <em>of the spirit</em> into the kingdom
of God. The dynamic force of his love has opened a
way to the land of love, and indescribable is the rejoicing
among those already there when new invaders
arrive, for each new arrival hastens the coming of the
Lord and the definite establishment of the Kingdom.</p>

<p>Among the religiously inclined there is a definite
unceasing cry: How long, O Lord; how long? And
despite the emphatic statement of Christ that the day
and hour are unknown, even to Himself, prophets con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>tinue
to gain credence when they predict His coming
on a certain day, though each is discomfited when the
day passes without development. The question has
also been mooted among our students, and the present
chapter is an attempt to show the fallacy of looking for
the Second Advent in a year or fifty or five hundred.
The Elder Brothers decline to commit themselves
further than to point out what must first be accomplished.</p>

<p>At the time of Christ the sun was in about seven
degrees of Aries. Five hundred years were required
to bring the precession to the thirtieth degree of Pisces.
During that time the new church lived through a
stage of offensive and defensive violence well justifying
the words of Christ: “I came not to bring peace
but a sword.” Fourteen hundred years more have
elapsed under the negative influence of <em>Pisces</em>, which
has fostered the power of the church and bound the
people by creed and dogma.</p>

<p>In the middle of the last century the sun came
within orb of influence of the scientific sign <em>Aquarius</em>,
and although it will take about six hundred years before
the Aquarian Age commences, it is highly instructive
to note what changes the mere touch has wrought
in the world. Our limited space precludes enumeration
of the wonderful advances made since then; but
it is not too much to say that science, invention, and
resultant industry have completely changed the
world, its social life, and economic conditions. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
great strides made in means of communication have
done much to break down barriers of race prejudice
and prepare us for conditions of Universal Brotherhood.
Engines of destruction have been made so
fearfully efficient that the militant nations will be
forced ere long to “beat their swords into plowshares
and their spears into pruning hooks.” <em>The sword has
had its reign</em> during the Piscean Age, but <em>science will
rule</em> in the Aquarian Age.</p>

<p>In the land of the setting sun we may expect to first
see the ideal conditions of the Aquarian Age: A blending
of religion and science, forming a religious science
and a scientific religion, which will promote the
health, happiness and the enjoyment of life in abundant
measure.</p>


<h3><i>Sugar For Alcohol</i></h3>

<p>In the chapter elucidating the Law of Assimilation
in the <cite>Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception</cite>, we stated that
minerals cannot be assimilated because they lack a
vital body, which lack makes it impossible for man to
raise their vibratory rate to his own pitch. Plants
have a vital body and no self-consciousness, hence are
most easily assimilated and remain with man longer
than cells of animal flesh, which is permeated by a
desire body. The vibratory rate of the latter is high,
and much energy is required in assimilation; its cells
also quickly escape and make it necessary for the
flesh eater to forage often.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p>We are aware that alcohol is a “foreign spirit”
and a “spirit of decay,” because <em>it is generated by
fermentation</em> <span class="smcap lowercase">OUTSIDE</span> the consumer’s system. Being
“spirit,” it vibrates with such intense rapidity that
the human spirit is incapable of tuning it down and
controlling it as food must be, hence metabolism is out
of the question. Nay, more, as we cannot reduce its
vibratory rate to that of our bodies, this foreign spirit
may accelerate their vibratory pitch and control us as
happens in the state of intoxication. Thus alcohol is
a great danger to mankind and one from which we
must be emancipated ere we can realize our divine
nature.</p>

<p>A stimulant spirit is necessary while we live on a
<em>diet of flesh</em> or progress would stop, and <em>a food</em> has
been provided for the pioneers of the West that answers
all requirements; its name is “sugar.” <em>From
sugar the ego itself generates alcohol</em> <span class="smcap lowercase">INSIDE</span> the system
by the very processes of metabolism. This product
is therefore both food and stimulant, perfectly keyed
to the vibratory pitch of the body. It has all the good
qualities of alcohol in enhanced measure and none of
its drawbacks. To perceive properly the effect of this
food, consider the peoples of eastern Europe where
but little sugar is consumed. They are slavish; they
speak of themselves in terms of depreciation; the pronoun
“I” is always spelled with small letters but
“you” with a capital. England consumes five times
as much sugar per capita as Russia. In the former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
we meet a different spirit, the big “I” and the little
“you.” In America the candy store becomes a most
dangerous rival of the saloon, for <em>the man who eats
sweets will not drink</em>, and there is no surer cure for
alcoholism than to induce the sufferer to eat freely of
sweets. The drunkard abhors sugar, however, while
his system is under the sway of the “foreign spirit.”</p>

<p>The temperance movement was begun in the land
where <em>most sugar is consumed</em>, and has <em>generated “the
spirit of self-respect.”</em></p>

<span class="smcap">Meat and Drink as Factors In Evolution</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In previous</span> chapters we saw how infant humanity
was cared for by superhuman guardians,
provided with appropriate food, led out of danger’s
way, and sheltered in all respects until grown to
human stature and fit to enter the school of experience
to learn the lessons of life in the phenomenal
world. We saw also how the rainbow points to natural
laws peculiar to the present age, how man was
given free will under these laws, and how the spirit
of wine was given to cheer and to stimulate his own
timid, fearful spirit, to nerve it for the war of the
world.</p>

<p>In an analogous manner the irresponsible little
child who has been brought under the waters of baptism
by its natural guardians is cared for through the
years of childhood while its various vehicles are being
organized. When the parental blood stored in the
thymus gland has been exhausted and the child thus
emancipated from the parents, it awakes to individuality,
to the feeling of “I AM.” It has then been pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>pared
with a knowledge of good and evil with which
to fight the battle of life; and at that time the youth
is taken to the church and given the bread and wine
to nerve and nourish him spiritually, also as a symbol
that henceforth he is a free agent, only responsible to
the laws of God. A blessing or a curse, this freedom,
according to the way it is used.</p>

<p>In early Atlantis mankind was a universal brotherhood
of submissive children with no incentive to war
or strife. Later they were segregated into nations,
and wars inculcated loyalty to kin and country. Each
sovereign was an absolute autocrat with power over
life and limb of his subjects, who were numbered in
hundreds of millions, and who yielded ungrudging
and slavish submission, an attitude maintained to the
present day among the millions of Asiatics, who are
vegetarians and consequently need no alcohol.</p>

<p>As flesh eating came into vogue, wine became a
more and more common beverage. In consequence of
flesh eating much material progress was made immediately
preceding the advent of Christ, and because of
the practice of drinking wine an increasing number of
men asserted themselves as leaders, with the result
that instead of a few large nations such as people
Asia, many small nations were formed in the southwestern
portion of Europe and Asia Minor.</p>

<p>But though the great mass of people who formed
these various nations were ahead of their Asiatic
brethren as craftsmen, they continued submissive to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
their rulers and lived as much in their traditions as
did the latter. Christ upbraided them because they
gloried in being Abraham’s seed. He told them that
“before Abraham was, <span class="smcap lowercase">I AM</span>,” that is, the ego has always
existed.</p>

<p>It is His mission to emancipate humanity from
Law and lead it to <span class="smcap lowercase">LOVE</span>, to destroy “the kingdoms of
men” with all their antagonism to one another, and
to build upon their ruins “the kingdom of God.” An
illustration will make the method clear:</p>

<p>If we have a number of brick buildings and desire
to amalgamate them into one large structure, it is
necessary to break them down first and free each
brick from the mortar which binds it. Likewise each
human being must be freed from the fetters of family,
hence Christ taught “Unless a man leave father and
mother he cannot be my disciple.” He must outgrow
religious partisanship and patriotism and learn to
say with the much misunderstood and maligned
Thomas Paine: “<em>The world is my country, and to do
good is my religion</em>.”</p>

<p>Christ did not mean that we are to forsake those
who have a claim upon our help and support, but that
we are not to permit the suppression of our individuality
out of deference to family traditions and beliefs.</p>

<p>Consequently He came “not to bring peace, but a
sword;” and whereas the eastern religions discourage
the use of wine, <em>Christ’s first miracle was to change
water to wine</em>. The sword and the wine cup are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
signatures of the Christian religion, for by them nations
have been broken to pieces and the individual
emancipated. Government by the people, for the people,
is a fact in northwestern Europe, the rulers being
that principally in name only.</p>

<p>But the fostering of the martial spirit such as prevails
in Europe was only a means to an end. The segregation
which it has caused must give place to a
regime of brotherhood such as professed by Paine. A
new step was necessary to bring this about; <em>a new food</em>
must be found which would act upon the spirit in
such a way as to foster individuality through <em>assertion
of self without oppression of others and without loss
of self-respect</em>. We have enunciated it as a law that
only spirit can act upon spirit, and therefore that
food must be a spirit but differing in other respects
from intoxicants.</p>

<p>Before describing this let us see what flesh has done
for the evolution of the world.</p>

<p>We have noted previously that during the Polarian
Epoch man had only a dense body; he was like the
present minerals in this respect, and by nature he was
as inert and passive.</p>

<p>By absorbing the crystalloids prepared by plants
he evolved a vital body during the Hyperborean
Epoch and became plantlike both in constitution and
by nature, for he lived without exertion and as unconsciously
as the plants.</p>

<p>Later he extracted milk from the then stationary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
animals. Desire for this more readily digestible food
spurred him on to exertion, and gradually his desire
nature was evolved during the Lemurian Epoch. Thus
he became constituted like the present day <i>Herbivora</i>.
Though possessed of a passional nature, he was docile
and could not be induced to fight save to defend himself,
his mate, and family. Hunger alone had the
power to make him aggressive.</p>

<p>Therefore, when animals began to move and sought
to elude this ruthless parasite, increasing difficulty of
obtaining the coveted food aroused his craving to such
an extent that when he had hunted and caught an
animal, he was no longer content to suck its udders
dry but commenced to feed upon its blood and flesh.
Thus he became as ferocious as our present day
Carnivora.</p>

<p>Digestion of flesh food requires much more powerful
chemical action and speedy elimination of the
waste than that of a vegetable diet as proved by
chemical analysis of the gastric juices from animals,
and by the fact that the intestines of Herbivora are
many times longer than those of a carnivorous animal
of even size. Carnivora easily become drowsy and
averse to exertion.</p>

<p>When prodded by the pangs of hunger the ferocious
wolf does indeed pursue its prey with unwavering
perseverance, and the spring of the crouching king of
beasts overmatches the speed of the wing-footed deer.
By ambush the feline family foil the fleetest in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
attempts to escape. The cunning of the fox is
proverbial, and the slinking nocturnal habits of the
hyena and kindred scavengers illustrate the depth of
depravity resulting from a diet of decayed flesh.</p>

<p>The vices generated by flesh eating may be said
to be lassitude, ferocity, low cunning, and depravity.
We may tame the herbivorous ox and elephant. Their
diet makes them docile and stores enormous power
which they obediently use in our service to perform
prolonged and arduous labor. The flesh food required
by the constitutional peculiarities of Carnivora makes
them dangerous and incapable of thorough domestication.
A cat may scratch at any moment, and the
muzzling ordinances of large cities are ample proof
of the danger of dogs. Besides, energy contained in
the diet of Carnivora is so largely expended in digestion
that they are drowsy and unfitted for sustained
labor like the horse or elephant.</p>

<p>The drowsiness following a heavy meal of meat is
too well known to require argument, and the custom
of taking stimulants with food is an outgrowth of the
desire to counteract the deadening effect of dead
flesh. The intensified effect of feasting upon <em>flesh in
an advanced state of decay</em> is well illustrated in
“society,” where banquets of game that is “high”
are accompanied by orgies of the wildest nature and
followed by indulgence of the vilest instincts.</p>

<p>The Westerner who can live upon a clean, sweet,
wholesome diet of vegetables, cereals, and fruits, does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
not become drowsy from his food; he needs no stimulant.
<em>There are no vegetarian drunkards.</em> The soothing
effects of vegetable food manifest as finer feelings,
which replace the ferocity fostered by flesh food.
Many need the mixed diet yet, for the practice of
flesh eating has furthered the progress of the world
as nothing else except perhaps its companion vice—drunkenness;
and though we cannot say that they
have been blessings in disguise, they have at least not
been unmitigated curses, for in the Father’s kingdom
all seeming evil nevertheless works for good in some
respect, though it may not be apparent upon the
surface. We shall see how presently.</p>

<p>A private corporation, the East India Company,
commenced and practically achieved the subjugation
of India with her three hundred million people, for
the English are voracious flesh eaters, while the
Hindu’s diet fosters docility. But when England
fought the flesh eating Boers, Greek met Greek, and
the valor displayed by both sides is a matter of brilliant
record. Courage, physical as well as moral, is
a virtue and cowardice a vice. Flesh has fostered self-assertion
and helped us to develop a backbone, though
unfortunately often at the expense of others who still
retain the wishbone. It has done more as will be
illustrated:</p>

<p>As said previously, the crouching cat is forced to
employ strategy to save strength when procuring its
prey, so that it may retain sufficient energy to digest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
the victim. Thus brain becomes the ally of brawn.
In ancient Atlantis <em>desire for flesh developed the ingenuity
of primitive man and led him</em> to trap the
elusive denizens of field and forest. The hunter’s
snare was among the first <span class="smcap lowercase">LABOR-SAVING DEVICES</span>—which
mark the beginning of the evolution of mind,
and of the uncompromising, unflagging struggle of
the meat fed mind for supremacy over matter.</p>

<p>We say “<em>the meat fed mind</em>,” and we reiterate it,
because we wish to emphasize that it is by the nations
which have adopted flesh food that the most noteworthy
progress has been made. The vegetarian
Asiatics remain upon the lower rungs of civilization.
The further west we travel, <em>the more the consumption
of meat increases as does the disinclination for bodily
exercise, and consequently the activity of the mind is
increased to a higher and higher pitch in the invention
of labor-saving devices</em>. The American agriculturists’
acres are counted by thousands, and they harvest
large crops with less labor than the peasant of the
East who has only a small patch of ground. The reason
is that the poor, plodding, grain fed Easterner has
only his hands and his hoe, which he keeps in motion
all day and day after day, while the meat fed, progressive
Westerner turns power-driven implements
into his fertile fields and sits down in a comfortable
seat to watch them work. One uses muscle, the other
mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p>Thus the indomitable courage and energy which
have transformed the face of the Western World are
virtues directly traceable to flesh food, which also
fosters love of ease and invention of labor-saving devices;
while alcohol stimulates enterprise in execution
of schemes thus hatched to procure the maximum of
comfort with a minimum of labor.</p>

<p>But the spirit of alcohol is obtained by a process of
fermentation. It is a <em>spirit of decay</em>, altogether different
from the <em>spirit of life</em> in man. This counterfeit
spirit lures man on and on, always holding before
his vision dreams of <em>future</em> grandeur, and goading
him to strenuous efforts of body and mind in order
to attain and obtain. Then when he has achieved and
attained, he awakens to the utter worthlessness of his
prize. Possession soon shatters illusion as to the worth
of whatever he may have acquired; <em>nothing the world
has to give can finally satisfy</em>. Then again the lethal
draught drowns disappointment, and the mind conjures
up a new illusion. This he pursues with fresh
zeal and high hopes to meet disappointment again and
again, for lives and lives, until at last he learns that
“wine is a mocker,” and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> “all is vanity but to
serve God and to do His will.”</p>

<span class="smcap">A Living Sacrifice</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Volumes, or rather</span> libraries, have been
written to explain the nature of God, but it is
probably a universal experience that the more we read
of other people’s explanations, the less we understand.
There is one description, given by the inspired apostle
John when he wrote “<em>God is Light</em>,” which is as
illuminating as the others are befogging to the mind.
Anyone who takes this passage for meditation occasionally
will find a rich reward waiting, for no matter
how many times we take up this subject, our own
development in the passing years assures us each time
a fuller and better understanding. Each time we
sink ourselves in these three words we lave in a spiritual
fountain of inexhaustible depth, and each succeeding
time we sound more thoroughly the divine
depths and draw more closely to our Father in heaven.</p>

<p>To get in touch with our subject, let us go back in
time to get our bearing and the direction of our future
line of progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>The first time our consciousness was directed towards
the Light was shortly after we had become endowed
with mind and had entered definitely upon
our evolution as human beings in Atlantis, the land of
the mist, deep down in the basins of the earth, where
the warm mist emitted from the cooling earth hung
like a dense fog over the land. Then the starry heights
of the universe were never seen, nor could the silvery
light of the moon penetrate the dense, foggy atmosphere
which hung over that ancient land. Even the
fiery splendor of the sun was almost totally extinguished,
for when we look in the Memory of Nature
pertaining to that time, it appears very much as an
arc lamp on a high pole looks to us when it is foggy.
It was exceedingly dim, and had an aura of various
colors, very similar to those which we observe around
an arc light.</p>

<p>But this light had a fascination. The ancient Atlanteans
were taught by the divine Hierarchs who
walked among them, to aspire to the light, and as the
spiritual sight was then already on the wane (even
the messengers, or Elohim, being perceived with difficulty
by the majority), they aspired all the more
ardently to the new light, for they feared the darkness
of which they had become conscious through the gift
of mind.</p>

<p>Then came the inevitable flood when the mist
cooled and condensed. The atmosphere cleared, and
the “<em>chosen people</em>” were saved. Those who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
worked within themselves and learned to build the
necessary organs required to breathe in an atmosphere
such as we have today, survived and came to the light.
It was not an arbitrary choice; <em>the work of the past
consisted of body building</em>. Those who had only gill
clefts, such as the foetus still uses in its prenatal development,
were as unfit physiologically to enter the
new era as the foetus would be to be born were it to
neglect to build lungs. It would die as those ancient
people died when the rare atmosphere made gill clefts
useless.</p>

<p>Since the day when we came out of ancient Atlantis
our bodies have been practically complete, that is
to say, no new vehicles are to be added; but from
that time and from now on <em>those who wish to follow
the light must strive for soul growth</em>. The bodies
which we have crystallized about us must be dissolved,
and the quintessence of experience extracted, which
as “soul” may be amalgamated with the spirit to
nourish it from impotence to omnipotence. Therefore,
the Tabernacle in the Wilderness was given to the
ancients, and the <em>light of God descended upon the
Altar of Sacrifice</em>. This is of great significance: The
ego had just descended into its tabernacle, the body.
We all know the tendency of the primitive instinct
towards selfishness, and if we have studied the higher
ethics we also know how subversive of good the indulgence
of the egotistic tendency is; therefore, God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
immediately placed before mankind the Divine Light
upon the Altar of Sacrifice.</p>

<p>Upon this altar they were forced by dire necessity
to offer their cherished possessions for every transgression,
God appearing to them as a hard taskmaster
whose displeasure it was dangerous to incur. But still
the Light drew them. They knew then that it was
futile to attempt to escape from the hand of God.
They had never heard the words of John, “God is
Light,” but they had already learned from the
heavens in a measure the meaning of infinitude, as
measured by the realm of light, for we hear David
exclaim: “Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? or
whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up
into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell,
thou art there. If I take the wings of the morning,
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even
there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall
hold me. If I say, surely the darkness shall cover me,
even the night shall be light about me. Yea, the
darkness hideth not from thee, but the night shineth
as the day, for the darkness and the light are both
alike to thee.”</p>

<p>With every year that passes, with the aid of the
greatest telescopes which the ingenuity and mechanical
skill of man have been able to construct to pierce
the depths of space, it becomes more evident that the
infinitude of light teaches us the infinitude of God.
When we hear that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span> “men loved darkness rather than
Light because their deeds were evil,” that also rings
true to what we unfortunately know as present day
facts, and illumines the nature of God for us; for is
it not true that we always feel endangered in the dark,
but that the light gives us a sense of safety which is
akin to the feeling of a child who feels the protecting
hand of its father?</p>

<p>To render permanent this condition of being in the
Light was the next step in God’s work with us, which
culminated in the birth of Christ, who as the bodily
presence of the Father, bore about in Himself that
Light, for the Light came into the world that whosoever
should believe in Christ should not perish, but
have everlasting life. He said, “I am the Light of the
World.” The altar in the Tabernacle had illustrated
the principle of sacrifice as the medium of regeneration,
so Christ said to His disciples: Greater love hath
no man than this, that he lay down his life for his
friends. Ye are my friends. And forthwith He commenced
a sacrifice, which, contrary to the accepted
orthodox opinion was not consummated in a few
hours of physical suffering upon a material cross, but
is as perpetual as were the sacrifices made upon the
altar of the Tabernacle in the Wilderness, for it entails
an annual descent into the earth and an endurance
of all that the cramping earth conditions must
mean to such a great spirit.</p>

<p>This must continue till a sufficient number have
evolved who can bear the burden of this dense lump<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
of <em>darkness</em> which we call the earth, and which hangs
as a millstone about the neck of humanity, an impediment
to further spiritual growth. Until we learn to
follow “in His steps,” we can rise no higher towards
the Light.</p>

<p>It is related that when Leonardo da Vinci had completed
his famous painting, “The Last Supper,” he
asked a friend to look at it and tell him what he
thought of it.</p>

<p>The friend looked at it critically for a few minutes
and then said:</p>

<p>“I think you have made a mistake in painting the
goblets from which the apostles drink so ornamental
and to resemble gold. People in their positions would
not drink from such expensive vessels.”</p>

<p>Da Vinci then drew his brush through the entire
set of vessels which had drawn the criticism of his
friend, but he was heartbroken, for he had painted
that picture with his soul rather than with his hands,
and he had prayed over it that it might speak a message
to the world. He had put all the greatness of
his art and the whole-hearted devotion of his soul into
that effort to paint a Christ who should speak the
word that would lead men to emulate His deeds.</p>

<p>Can you see Him as He sits there at that festive
board, <span class="smcap lowercase">THE EMBODIMENT OF LIGHT</span>, and speaks those
wonderful, mystic words: <em>This is my body, this is my
blood, given for you</em>—a living sacrifice.</p>

<p>In the past period of our spiritual career we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
been looking for a Light <em>exterior</em> to ourselves, but now
we have arrived at the point where we must look for
the Christ light within and emulate Him by making
of ourselves “living sacrifices” as He is doing. Let
us remember that when the sacrifice which lies before
our door seems pleasant and to our liking, when we
seem able to pick and choose our work in His vineyard
and do what pleases us, we are not making a real
sacrifice as He did, nor are we when we are seen of
men and applauded for our benevolence. But when
we are ready to follow Him from that festive board
where He was the honored one among friends, into
the garden of Gethsemane <em>where He was alone</em> and
wrestled with the great problem before Him while His
friends slept, then are we making a living sacrifice.</p>

<p>When we are content to follow “in His steps” to
that point of self-sacrifice where we can say from the
bottom of our hearts, “<em>Thy will, not mine</em>,” then we
have surely <em>the light within</em>, and there will never
henceforth be for us that which we feel as darkness.
<em>We shall walk in the light.</em></p>

<p>This is our glorious privilege, and the meditation
upon the words of the apostle, “God is Light,” will
help us to realize this ideal provided we add to our
faith, <em>works</em>, and say by our deeds as did the Christ
of da Vinci, “<em>This is my body and this is my blood</em>,”
a living sacrifice upon the altar of humanity.</p>

<span class="smcap">Magic, White and Black</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">From time</span> to time as occasion requires we warn
students of the Rosicrucian Fellowship in our
private individual letters not to attend spirit seances,
hypnotic demonstrations, or places where incense is
burned by dabblers in occultism. Black Magic is
practiced both consciously and unconsciously to an extent
that is almost unbelievable. “Malicious animal
magnetism,” which is only another name for the Black
Force, is responsible for more failures in business, loss
of health, and unhappiness in homes than most people
are aware of. Even the perpetrators of such outrages
are, as said, often unconscious of what harm they have
done. Therefore it seems expedient to devote a chapter
to an explanation of some of the laws of magic, which
are the same for the white as for the black. There is
only one force, but it may be used for good or evil; and
according to the motive behind it and the use that is
made of it, it becomes either black or white.</p>

<p>It is a scientific axiom that “<i lang="la">Ex nihil, nihil fit</i>” (out
of nothing nothing comes). There must be a seed be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>fore
there can be a flower, but where the first seed
came from is something which science has failed to
explain. The occultist knows that all things have
come from <i>arche</i>, the infinite essence of chaos, used
by God, the Grand Architect, for the building of our
universe; and, given the nucleus of anything, the
accomplished magician can draw upon the same essence
for a further supply. Christ, for instance, had
some loaves and some fishes; by means of that nucleus
He drew upon the primordial essence of chaos for the
rest needed in performing the miracle of feeding a
multitude. A human magician whose power is not so
high can more easily draw upon the things which have
already materialized out of chaos. He may take
flowers or fruit belonging to some one else, miles or
hundreds of miles away, disintegrate them into their
atomic constituents, transport them through the air,
and cause them to assume their regular physical shape
in the room where he is entertaining friends in order
to amaze them. Such magic is <em>grey</em> at best, even if he
sends sufficient of his coin to pay for what he has
taken away; if he does not, it is Black Magic to thus
rob another of his goods. Magic to be white must
always be used unselfishly, and in addition, for a
noble purpose—to save a fellow being suffering. The
Christ, when He fed the multitude from chaos, gave
as His reason that they had been with Him for several
days, and if they had to journey back to their homes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
without physical food they would faint by the wayside
and suffer privation.</p>

<p>God is the Grand Architect of the Universe and the
Initiates of the White Schools are also arche-tektons,
builders from the primordial essence in their beneficent
work for humanity. These Invisible Helpers
require a nucleus from the patient’s vital body, which
is, as students of the Rosicrucian Fellowship know,
given to them in the effluvia from the hand, which
impregnates the paper when the patient makes application
for help and healing. With this nucleus of
the patient’s vital body they are able to draw upon
virgin matter for whatever they need to restore health
by building up and strengthening the organism.</p>

<p>The Black Magicians are despoilers, actuated by
hatred and malice. They also need a nucleus for their
nefarious operations, and this they obtain most easily
from the vital body at spiritualistic or hypnotic
seances, where the sitters relax, put themselves into
a negative frame of mind, drop their jaws, and sink
their individualities by other distinctly mediumistic
practices. Even people who do not frequent such
places are not immune, for there are certain products
of the vital body which are ignorantly scattered by all
and which may be used effectively by the Black
Magicians. Chief in this category are the hair
and finger nails. The Negroes in their voodoo
magic use the placenta for similar evil purposes. One
particularly evil man, whose practices were exposed a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
decade ago, obtained from boys the vital fluid which
he used for his demoniac acts. Even so innocent a
thing as a glass of water placed in close proximity to
certain parts of the body of the prospective victim,
while the Black Magician converses with him can
be made to absorb a part of the victim’s vital body.
This will give the Black Magician the requisite nucleus,
or it may be obtained from a piece of the person’s
clothing. The same invisible emanation contained
in the garment, which guides the bloodhound
upon the track of a certain person, will also guide the
Magician, white or black, to the abode of that person
and furnish the Magician with a key to the person’s
system whereby the former may help or hurt according
to his inclination.</p>

<p>But there are methods of protecting oneself from
inimical influences, which we shall mention in the
latter part of this chapter. We have debated much
whether it were wise or not to call the attention of students
to these facts, and have come to the conclusion
that it does not help anyone to imitate the ostrich
which sticks its head into a hole in the sand at the
approach of danger. It is better to be enlightened
concerning things that threaten so that we may take
whatever precautions are necessary to meet the
emergency. The battle between the good and the evil
forces is being waged with an intensity that no one not
engaged in the actual combat can comprehend. The
Elder Brothers of the Rosicrucians and kindred orders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
which, we may say, in their totality represent the
Holy Grail, live on the love and essence of the unselfish
service which they gather and garner as the
bees gather honey, from all who are striving to live
the life. This they add to the lustre of the Holy Grail,
which in turn grows more lustrous and radiates a
stronger influence upon all who are spiritually inclined,
imbuing them with greater ardor, zeal, and
zest in the good work and in fighting the good fight.
Similarly the evil forces of the Black Grail thrive on
hate, treachery, cruelty, and every demoniac deed on
the calendar of crime. Both the Black and the White
Grail forces require a pabulum, the one of good and
the other of evil, for the continuance of their existence
and for the power to fight. Unless they get it, they
starve and grow weaker. Hence the relentless struggle
that is going on between them.</p>

<p>Every midnight the Elder Brothers at their service
open their breasts to attract the darts of hate, envy,
malice, and every evil that has been launched during
the past twenty-four hours. First, in order that they
may deprive the Black Grail forces of their food; and
secondly, that they may transmute the evil to good.
Then, as the plants gather the inert carbon
dioxide exhaled by mankind and build their bodies
therefrom, so the Brothers of the Holy Grail transmute
the evil within the temple; and as the plants
send out the renovated oxygen so necessary to human
life, so the Elder Brothers return to mankind the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
transmuted essence of evil as qualms of conscience
along with the good in order that the world may grow
better day by day.</p>

<p>The Black Brothers, instead of transmuting the evil,
infuse a greater dynamic energy into it and speed it
on its mission in vain endeavors to conquer the powers
of good. They use for their purposes elementals and
other discarnate entities which, being themselves of a
low order, are available for such vile practices as required.
In the ages when men burned animal oil or
candles made from the tallow of animals, elementals
swarmed around them as devils or demons, seeking
to obsess whoever would offer an occasion. Even wax
tapers offer food for these entities, but the modern
methods of illumination by electricity, coal oil, or even
paraffin candles, are uncongenial to them. They still
flock around our saloons, slaughter houses, and
similar places where there are passionate animals, and
animal-like men. They also delight in places where
incense is burned, for that offers them an avenue of
access, and when the sitters at seances inhale the
odor of the incense they inhale elemental spirits with
it, which affect them according to their characters.</p>

<p>This is where the protection we spoke about before
may be used. When we live lives of purity, when our
days are filled with service to God and to our fellow-men,
and with thoughts and actions of the highest
nobility, then we create for ourselves the <em>Golden
Wedding Garment</em>, which is a radiant force for good.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
No evil is able to penetrate this armor for the evil
then acts as a boomerang and recoils on the one who
sent it, bringing to him the evil he wished us.</p>

<p>But alas, none of us are altogether good. We know
only too well the war between the flesh and the spirit.
We cannot hide from ourselves the fact that like Paul,
“the good that we would do, we do not, and the evil
that we would shun, that we do.” Far too often our
good resolutions come to naught and we do wrong
because it is easier. Therefore we all have the nucleus
of evil within ourselves, which affords the open
sesame for the evil forces to work upon. For that
reason it is best for us not unnecessarily to expose
ourselves at places where seances are held with
spirits invisible to us, no matter how fine their teachings
may sound to the unsophisticated. Neither should
we take part even as spectators at hypnotic demonstrations,
for there also a negative attitude lays one liable
to the danger of obsession. We should at all times
follow the advice of Paul and put on the whole armor
of God. We should be positive in our fight for the
good against the evil and never let an occasion slip
to aid the Elder Brothers by word or deed in the
Great War for spiritual supremacy.</p>

<span class="smcap">Our Invisible Government</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It is well</span> known to students of the Rosicrucian
Philosophy that each species of animals is dominated
by a group spirit, which is their guardian and
looks after these, its wards, with a view to bringing
them along the path of evolution that is best suited
to their development; it does not matter what the
geographical position of these animals is; the lion in
the jungles of Africa is dominated by the same group
spirit as is the lion in the cage of a menagerie in our
northern countries. Therefore these animals are
alike in all their principal characteristics; they have
the same likes and dislikes with respect to diet, and
they act in an almost identical manner under similar
circumstances. If one wants to study the tribe of lions
or the tribe of tigers, all that is necessary is to study
one individual, for it has neither choice nor prerogative,
but acts entirely according to the dictates of the
group spirit. The mineral cannot choose whether it
will crystallize or not; the rose is bound to bloom; the
lion is compelled to prey; and in each case the activity
is dictated entirely by the group spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<p>But man is different; when we want to study him
we find that each individual is as a species by himself.
What one does under any given circumstances is no indication
of what another may do; “one man’s meat
is another man’s poison”; each has different likes and
dislikes. This is because man as we see him in the
physical world is the expression of an individual indwelling
spirit, seemingly having choice and prerogative.</p>

<p>But as a matter of fact man is not quite as free as
he seems; all students of human nature have observed
that on certain occasions a large number of people
will act as though dominated by one spirit. It is also
easy to see without recourse to occultism that the different
nations have certain physical characteristics.
We all know the German, French, English, Italian,
and Spanish types. Each of these nations has characteristics
which differ from those of the other nations,
thus indicating that there must be a <em>race spirit</em> at the
root of these peculiarities. The occultist who is gifted
with spiritual sight knows that such is the case, and
that each nation has a different race spirit which
broods as a cloud over the whole country. In it the
people live and move and have their being; it is their
guardian and is constantly working for their development,
building up their civilization and fostering
ideals of the highest nature compatible with their
capacity for progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<p>In the Bible we read that <i lang="he">Jehovah</i>, <i lang="he">Elohim</i>, who was
the race spirit of the Jews, went before them in a pillar
and a cloud, and in the Book of Daniel we gain considerable
insight into the workings of these race
spirits. The image seen by Nebuchadnezzar with its
head of gold and feet of clay showed plainly how a
civilization built up in the beginning with golden
ideals degenerated more and more until in the latter
part of its existence the feet were of unstable, crumbling
clay, and the image was doomed to topple. Thus
all civilizations when started by the different race
spirits have great and golden ideals, but humanity by
reason of having some free will and choice does not
follow implicitly the dictates of the race spirits as the
animals follow the commands of the group spirits.
Hence in the course of time a nation ceases to rise, and
as there can be no standing still in the cosmos, it begins
to degenerate until finally the feet are of clay
and it is necessary to strike a blow to shatter it, <em>that
another civilization may be built up on its ruins</em>.</p>

<p>But empires do not fall without a strong physical
blow, and therefore an instrument of the race spirit
of a nation is always raised up at the time when that
nation is doomed to fall. In the tenth and eleventh
chapters of Daniel we are given an insight into the
workings of the invisible government of the race
spirits, the powers behind the throne. Daniel is much
disturbed in spirit; he fasts, for fully <em>three weeks</em>,
praying for light, and at the end of that time an arch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>angel,
a race spirit, appears before him and addresses
him: “Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that
thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to
chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard,
and I am come for thy words. But the prince of the
kingdom of Persia withstood me <em>one and twenty days</em>,
but lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help
me; and I remained there with the king of Persia.”
After he explains to Daniel what is to happen, he says:
“Knowest thou wherefore I came unto thee? <em>and now
will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and
when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall
come</em>, and there is none that holdeth with me in these
things, but Michael, your prince.” The archangel
also says: “In the first year of Darius the Mede,
even I stood to confirm and to strengthen him.”</p>

<p>So when the handwriting is on the wall, some one
is raised up to administer the blow; it may be a Cyrus,
a Darius, an Alexander, a Caesar, a Napoleon, or a
kaiser. Such a one may think himself a prime mover,
a free individual acting by his own choice and prerogative,
but as a matter of fact he is only the instrument
of the invisible government of the world, the power
behind thrones, the race spirits, who see the necessity
of breaking up civilizations that have outlived their
usefulness, so that humanity may get a new start and
evolve under a new and a higher ideal than that which
ensouled it before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>Christ himself when upon earth, said: “I came not
to bring peace, but a sword,” for it was evident to
Him that as long as humanity was divided into races
and nations there could be no “peace on earth and
good will among men.” Only when the nations have
become united in a universal brotherhood is peace
possible. The barriers of nationalism must be done
away with, and to this end the United States of
America has been made a melting pot where all that
is best in the old nations is being brought together
and amalgamated, so that <em>a new race with higher
ideals and feelings of universal brotherhood may be
born for the Aquarian Age</em>. In the meantime the
barriers of nationalism have been partially broken
down in Europe by the terrible conflict just past. This
brings nearer the day of universal amity and the
realization of the Brotherhood of Man.</p>

<p>There is also another object to be gained. Of all
the terrors to which mankind is subjected, there is
none so great as <em>death</em>, which separates us from those
we love, because we are unable to see them after they
have stepped out of their bodies. But just as surely
as the day follows the night, so will every teardrop
wear away some of the scale that now blinds the eyes
of man to the unseen land of the living dead. We have
said repeatedly and we now reaffirm that one of the
greatest blessings which will come from the war will
be the spiritual sight which a great number of people
will evolve. The intense sorrow of millions of people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
the longing to see again the dear ones who have so
suddenly and ruthlessly been torn from us, are a
force of incalculable strength and power. Likewise
those who have been snatched by death in the prime
of life and who are now in the invisible world are
equally intense in their desires to be reunited with
those near and dear to them, so that they may speak
the word of comfort and assure them of their well-being.
Thus it may be said that two great armies comprising
millions upon millions are tunneling with
frantic energy and intensity of purpose through the
wall that separates the invisible from the visible. Day
by day this wall or veil is growing thinner, and sooner
or later the living and the living dead will meet in the
middle of the tunnel. Before we realize it, communication
will have been established, and we shall find it a
common experience that when our loved ones step out
of their worn and sick bodies, we shall feel neither
sorrow nor loss because we shall be able to see them
in their ethereal bodies, moving among us as they
used to do. So out of the great conflict we shall
come as victors over death and be able to say:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span> “O
death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy
victory?”</p>

<span class="smcap">Practical Precepts For Practical People</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">“If I were</span> to do business on the principles laid
down in the Sermon on the Mount I would be
down and out in less than a year,” said a critic recently.
“Why, the Bible is utterly impracticable
under our present economic conditions; it is impossible
to live according to it.”</p>

<p>If that is true there is a good reason for the unbelief
of the world, but in a court the accused is always
allowed a fair trial, and let us examine the
Bible thoroughly before we judge. What are the
specific charges? “Why, they are countless,” answered
the critic, “but to mention only a few, let us
take such passages as, ‘Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven;’ ‘Blessed are
the meek for they shall inherit the earth;’ ‘Take no
thought for the morrow, what ye shall eat or what ye
shall drink.’ Such ideas point the way to the poor-house.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” says the apologist,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span> “let us take the
last charge first. King James’ version says: ’No man
can serve two masters. Ye cannot serve God and
mammon, therefore I say unto you, take no thought
for your life, what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink,
nor yet for your body what ye shall put on. Is not
the life more than food and the body than raiment?
Behold the fowls of the air: they sow not, neither do
they reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly
Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than
they? Which of you by taking thought can add one
cubit unto his stature? And why take ye thought for
raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they
grow: they toil not, neither do they spin. And yet
I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not
arrayed like one of these. Wherefore, if God so clothe
the grass of the field, which today is and tomorrow
is cast into the oven, shall He not much more clothe
you, O ye of little faith? Therefore take no thought,
saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink?
or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? for after all these
things do the Gentiles seek; your heavenly Father
knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But
seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness
and all these things shall be added unto you.’”</p>

<p>If this is intended to mean that we should wastefully
squander all we have in prodigal or riotous living,
then it is of course not only impractical but demoralizing.
Such an interpretation is, however, out
of keeping with the tenor and teaching of the whole
Book, and it does not say so. The Greek word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
<i lang="el">merimnon</i> means being overly careful or anxious,
and if we read the passage with this alteration we
shall find that it teaches a different lesson which is
entirely practical. Mammon is the Syriac word for
riches, desired by foolish people. In the preceding
paragraph Christ exhorted them not to become servants
or slaves to riches, which they must leave behind
when the silver cord is broken and the spirit returns
to God, but seek rather to live lives of love and
service and lay up treasures of good deeds, which
they might take with them into the Kingdom of
Heaven. In the meantime, He exhorted, be not overly
anxious regarding what you shall eat and drink and
clothe yourself with. Why worry? You cannot add
a hairbreadth to your height or a hair to your head
by worrying. Worry is the most wasteful and depleting
of all our emotions, and it does no good whatever.
Your heavenly Father knows you need material
things, therefore seek first His kingdom and
righteousness and all else needed will be added. On
at least two occasions when multitudes came to Christ
in places far from their homes and distant from
towns where refreshment was obtainable, He demonstrated
this; He gave them first the spiritual food
they sought and then ministered to their bodily needs
direct from a spiritual source of supply.</p>

<p>Does it work out in these modern days? Surely
there have been so many demonstrations of this that
it is not at all necessary to recount any special one.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
When we work and pray, pray and work, and make
our lives a living prayer for opportunities to serve
others, then all earthly things will come of their own
accord as we need them, and they will keep coming
in larger measure according to the degree to which
they are used in the service of God. If we regard
ourselves only as stewards and custodians of whatever
earthly goods we possess, then we are really
“<em>poor in spirit</em>” so far as the evanescent earthly
treasures are concerned, but rich in the more lasting
treasures of the Kingdom of Heaven; and if we are
not out and out materialists, surely this is a practical
attitude.</p>

<p>It is not so long ago that “<i lang="la">caveat emptor</i>,” “Let
the buyer beware,” was the slogan of the merchants
who sought after earthly treasures and regarded the
buyer as their legitimate prey. When they had sold
their wares and received the money, it did not matter
to them whether the buyer was satisfied or not. They
even prided themselves on selling an inferior article
which would soon wear out, as evident in the shortsighted
motto, “The weakness of the goods is the
strength of the trade.” But gradually even people
who would scorn the idea of introducing religion into
their business are discarding this <em>caveat emptor</em> as a
motto, and are unconsciously adapting the precept
of Christ, “<em>He that would be the greatest among you,
let him be the servant of all</em>.” Everywhere the best
business men are insistent in their claim to patronage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
on the ground of the service they give to the buyer,
because it is a policy that pays, and may therefore be
classed as another of the practical precepts of the
Bible.</p>

<p>But it sometimes happens that in spite of their desire
to serve their customers, something goes wrong
and an angry, dissatisfied buyer comes blustering in,
decrying their goods. Under the old shortsighted
regime of <i lang="la">caveat emptor</i> the merchant would have
merely laughed or thrown the buyer out of the door.
Not so the modern merchant, who takes his Bible into
business. He remembers the wisdom of Solomon
that “a soft answer turneth away wrath,” and the
assertion of Christ that “<em>the meek shall inherit the
earth</em>,” so he apologizes for the fault in the goods,
offers restitution, and sends the erstwhile dissatisfied
customer away smiling and eager to sing the praises
of the concern that treats him so nicely. Thus by
obeying the practical precept of the Bible, keeping his
temper in meekness, the business man gains additional
customers who come to him in full faith of fair
treatment, and the added profit in sales made to them
soon overbalances the loss on goods which may have
caused the dissatisfaction of other customers.</p>

<p>It pays dividends in dollars and cents to keep one’s
temper and be meek; it pays greater dividends from
the moral and spiritual standpoints. What better
business motto can be found than in Ecclesiastes:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
“Wisdom is better than weapons of war. Be not rash
in thy mouth, be not hasty in thy speech to be angry,
for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.” Tact and
diplomacy are always better than force; as the Good
Book says: “If the iron be blunt we must use more
strength, but wisdom is profitable to direct.” The
line of least resistance, so long as it is clean and honorable,
is always the best. Therefore, “<em>Love your
enemies, do good to them that despitefully use you</em>.”</p>

<p>It is good practical business policy to try to reconcile
those who do us harm lest they do more; and it
is better for us to get over our ill feeling than to
nurse it, for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he
also reap, and if we sow spite and meanness, we
breed and beget in others the same feelings. Furthermore,
all these things will apply in private life and in
social intercourse just as in ordinary business. How
many quarrels could be avoided if we cultivated the
virtue of meekness in our homes; how much pleasure
would be gained; how much happiness would come
into our lives if in our social and business relations
we learned to <em>do unto others as we would that they
should do unto us</em>!</p>

<p>There is no need for the great mental strain that so
many of us are working under concerning what we
shall eat and what we shall drink. Our Father in
Heaven does own the earth and the fullness thereof;
the cattle on a thousand hills are His. If we learn
truly to cast our cares upon Him, there is no doubt
that the way out of our difficulties will be provided.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
It is a fact, acknowledged by all authorities who have
investigated the subject, that comparatively few people
die from lack of necessities of life, but a great
many die because of overindulgence of the appetites.
It is the practical experience of the writer and numerous
others that if we do our work day by day as it
appears before us, faithfully and to the best of our
ability, the wherewithal for the morrow will always
be provided. If we go according to the instruction of
the Bible, doing all “as unto the Lord,” it does not
matter what line of honest work we follow; we are
then at the same time seeking the Kingdom of God.
But if we are only time servers, working for fear or
favor, we cannot expect to succeed in the long run;
health, wealth, and happiness may attend us for a
little while, but outside the solid foundation of the
Bible there can be no lasting joy in life and no real
prosperity in business.</p>

<span class="smcap">Sound, Silence, and Soul Growth</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Sincere students</span> of the Science of the Soul
are naturally anxious to grow in grace that they
may serve so much better in the Great Work of
Human Upliftment. Being humble and modest they
are only too painfully aware of their shortcomings,
and frequently while casting about for means to facilitate
progress they ask themselves, “<em>What hinders?</em>”
Some, particularly in bygone ages when life was lived
less intensely than now, realized that the everyday
life among ordinary humanity had many drawbacks.
To overcome these and further their soul growth they
withdrew from the community to a monastery or to
the mountains where they could give themselves over
to the spiritual life undisturbed.</p>

<p>We know, however, that that is not the way. It is
too well established in the minds of most of our students
that if we run away from an experience today,
it will confront us again tomorrow, and that the
victor’s palm is earned by overcoming the world, not
by running away from it. The environment in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
we have been placed by the Recording Angels was our
own choice when we were at the turning point of our
life cycle in the Third Heaven, we then being pure
spirit unblinded by the matter which now veils our
vision. Hence it is undoubtedly the one that holds
lessons needed by us, and we should make a serious
mistake if we tried to escape from it altogether.</p>

<p>But we have received a mind for a definite purpose—to
reason about things and conditions so that
we may learn to discriminate between essentials and
nonessentials, between that which is designed to
hinder for the purpose of teaching us a virtue by overcoming
it, and that which is an out and out hindrance,
which jars our sensibilities and wrecks our nerves
without any compensating spiritual gain. It will be
of the greatest benefit if we can learn to differentiate
for the conservation of our strength, accepting only
that which we must endure for the sake of our spiritual
well-being. We shall then save much energy
and have much more zest in profitable directions than
now. The details of that problem are different in
every life; however, there are certain general principles
which it will benefit us all to understand and
apply in our lives, and among them is the effect of
silence and sound on soul growth.</p>

<p>At first blush it may surprise us when the statement
is made that sound and silence are very important
factors in soul growth, but when we examine the
matter we shall soon see that it is not a far-fetched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
notion. Consider first the graphic expression, “War
is hell,” and then call up in imagination a war
scene. The sight is appalling, even more so to those
who see it with the undimmed spiritual vision than to
those who are limited to physical sight, for the latter
can at least shut their eyes to it if they want to, but
the whole horror lies heavily upon the heart of the
Invisible Helper who not only hears and sees but <em>feels</em>
in his own being the anguish and pain of all the surrounding
suffering as Parsifal felt in his heart the
wound of Amfortas, the stricken Grail king; in fact,
without that intensely intimate feeling of oneness with
the suffering there could be no healing nor help given.
But there is one thing which no one can escape, the
terrible noise of the shells, the deafening roar of the
cannon, the vicious spitting of the machine guns, the
groans of the wounded, and the oaths of a certain
class among the participants. We shall need no
further argument to agree that it is really a “hellish
noise” and as subversive of soul growth as possible.
The battle field is the last place anyone with a sane
mind would choose for the purpose of soul growth,
though it is not to be forgotten that much of this has
been made by noble deeds of self-sacrifice there; but
such results have been achieved <em>in spite of</em> the condition
and not because of it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, consider a church filled with
the noble strains of a Gregorian chant or a Handel
oratorio upon which the prayers of the aspiring soul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
wing their way to the Author of our Being. That
music may surely be termed “<em>heavenly</em>” and the
church designated as offering an ideal condition for
soul growth, but if we stayed there permanently to
the neglect of our duties we should be failures in spite
of the ideal condition.</p>

<p>There remains, therefore, only one safe method for
us, namely, to stay in the din of the battle field of the
world, endeavoring to wrest from even the most unpromising
conditions the material of soul growth by
unselfish service, and at the same time <em>to build within
our own inner selves a sanctuary</em> filled with that silent
music which sounds ever in the serving soul as a
source of upliftment above all the vicissitudes of
earthly existence. Having that “living church”
<em>within</em>, being in fact under that condition “<em>living
temples</em>,” we may turn at any moment when our attention
is not legitimately required by temporal affairs
to that spiritual house not made with hands and
lave in its harmony. We may do that many times a
day and thus restore continually the harmony that
has been disturbed by the discords of terrestrial intercourse.</p>

<p>How then shall we build that temple and fill it with
the heavenly music we so much desire? What will help
and what will hinder? are the questions which call for
a practical solution, and we shall try to make the answer
as plain and practical as possible, for this is a
very vital matter. The <em>little things</em> are particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
important, for the neophyte needs to take even the
slightest things into account. If we light a match in
a strong wind it is extinguished ere it has gained a
fair start, but if the little flame is laid on a brush-heap
and given a chance to grow in comparative
calm, a rising wind will fan the flame instead of extinguishing
it. Adepts or Great Souls may remain
serene under conditions which would upset the ordinary
aspirant, hence he should use discrimination and
not expose himself unnecessarily to conditions subversive
of soul growth; what he needs more than
anything is <em>poise</em>, and nothing is more inimical to that
condition than <em>noise</em>.</p>

<p>It is undeniable that our communities are “Bedlams,”
and that we have a legitimate right to escape
some noises if possible, such as the screeching made
by street cars rounding a curve. We do not need to
live on such a corner to the detriment of our nerves or
endeavors at concentration, but if we have a sick, crying
child that requires our attention day and night,
it does not matter how it affects our nerves, we have
no right in the sight of God or man to run away or
neglect it in order to concentrate. These things are
perfectly obvious and produce instant assent, but the
things that help or hinder most are, as said, the things
that are so small that they escape our attention entirely.
When we now start to enumerate them, they
may provoke a smile of incredulity, but if they are
pondered upon and practiced they will soon win as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>sent,
for judged by the formula that “by their fruits
ye shall know them,” they will show results and
vindicate our assertion that “Silence is one of the
greatest helps in soul growth,” and should therefore
be cultivated by the aspirant in his home, his personal
demeanor, his walk, his habits, and paradoxical as it
seems, even in his speech.</p>

<p>It is a proof of the benefit of religion that it makes
people happy, but the greatest happiness is usually
too deep for outward expression. It fills our whole
being so full that it is almost awesome, and a boisterous
manner never goes together with that true
happiness for it is the sign of superficiality. The loud
voice, the coarse laugh, the noisy manner, the hard
heels that sound like sledge hammers, the slamming
of doors, and the rattling of dishes are the signatures
of the unregenerate, for they love noise, the more the
merrier, as it stirs their desire bodies. For their
purpose church music is anathema; a blaring brass
band is preferable to any other form of entertainment,
and the wilder the dance, the better. But it is otherwise,
or should be, with the aspirant to the higher
life.</p>

<p>When the infant Jesus was sought by Herod with
murderous intent, his only safety lay in flight, and
by that expedient were preserved his life and power
to grow and fulfill his mission. Similarly, when the
Christ is born within the aspirant he can best preserve
this spiritual life by fleeing from the environ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>ment
of the unregenerate where these hindering
things are practiced, and seek a place among others of
kindred ambitions provided he is free to do so; but if
placed in a position of responsibility to a family, it
is his duty to strive to alter conditions by precept
and example, particularly by example, so that in time
that refined, subdued atmosphere which breathes harmony
and strength may reign over the whole house.
It is not essential to the happiness of children that
they be allowed to shout at the top of their voices or
to race pell-mell through the house, slamming doors
and wrecking furniture in their mad race; it is indeed
decidedly detrimental, for it teaches them to disregard
the feelings of others in self-gratification. They will
benefit more than mother by being shod with rubber
heels and taught to reserve their romps for outdoors
and to play quietly in the house, closing doors easily,
and speaking in a moderated tone of voice such as
mother uses.</p>

<p>In childhood we begin to wreck the nerves that
bother us in later years, so if we teach our children
the lesson above indicated, we may save them much
trouble in life as well as further our own soul growth
now. It may take years to reform a household of these
seemingly unimportant faults and secure an atmosphere
conducive to soul growth, especially if the children
have grown to adult age and resent reforms of
that nature, but it is well worth while. We can and
<em>must</em> at least cultivate the virtue of silence in ourselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
or our own soul growth will be very small. Perhaps if
we look at the matter from its occult point of view in
connection with that important vehicle, <em>the vital
body</em>, the point of this necessity will be more clear.</p>

<p>We know that the vital body is ever storing up
power in the physical body which is to be used in this
“School of Experience,” and that during the day the
desire body is constantly dissipating this energy in
actions which constitute experience that is eventually
transmuted to soul growth. So far so good, but the
desire body has the tendency to run amuck if not held
in with a tight rein. It revels in <em>unrestrained</em> motion,
the wilder the better, and if unbridled makes the body
whistle, sing, jump, dance, and do all the other unnecessary
and undignified things which are so detrimental
to soul growth. While under such a spell of inharmony
and discord the person is dead to the spiritual
opportunities in the physical world, and at
night when he leaves his body the process of
restoration of that vehicle consumes so much time that
very little, if any, time is left for work, even if the
person has the inclination to think seriously of doing
such work.</p>

<p>Therefore we ought by all means to flee from noises
which we are not obliged to hear, and cultivate personally
the quiet yet kindly demeanor, the modulated
voice, the silent walk, the unobtrusive presence, and
all the other virtues which make for harmony, for
then the restorative process is quickly accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
and we are free the major part of the night to work
in the invisible worlds to gain more soul growth. Let
us in this attempt at improvement remember to be
undaunted by occasional failures, remembering Paul’s
admonition to continue in well-doing with patient
persistence.</p>

<span class="smcap">The “Mysterium Magnum” of the Rose Cross</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Occasionally</span> we get letters from students
voicing their regret that they are alone in the
study of the Rosicrucian Philosophy, that their husbands,
wives, children, or other relatives are unsympathetic
or even antagonistic to the teachings, despite
all efforts of the said students to interest favorably
these friends and thus obtain companionship in their
studies, or at least freedom to follow their bent. This
friction causes them a certain amount of unhappiness
according to their various temperaments, and we are
asked by these students to advise them how to overcome
the antagonism and convert their relatives. This
we have done by personal letters and have been privileged
to help change conditions in not a few homes
when our advice has been followed; but we know that
frequently those who suffer most acutely are silent,
and we have therefore decided to devote a little time
to a discussion of the subject.</p>

<p>It is truly said, very truly, that “a little knowledge
is a dangerous thing,” and this applies with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
same force to the Rosicrucian teachings as to any
other subject. Therefore, the very first step is to find
out <em>if you have enough knowledge</em> to be on the safe
side. So let me ask the question: What is the Rosicrucian
teaching which you are so anxious to have
others share and to which they object? Is it the twin
laws of “<em>Causation</em>” and “<em>Rebirth</em>?” They are excellent
for explaining a great many problems of life, and
they are a great comfort when the grim reaper appears
and robs our home of some one near and dear.
But then you must remember that there are many who
do not feel the need of any explanation whatever.
They are constitutionally as unfit to apply it as a deaf
mute is to use a telephone. It is true that we work
to better advantage when conscious of the law and its
purpose, but let us take comfort from the fact that
these laws work for good to all whether they know
it or not, and therefore <em>this knowledge is not essential</em>.
They will suffer no great loss because they do
not embrace this doctrine, and they may escape the
danger incident to the possession of “a little knowledge.”</p>

<p>In India where these truths are known and believed
by millions, people make little effort at material progress
because they know that they have endless time,
and what they do not accomplish in this life may wait
till the next or a later life. Many Westerners who
have embraced the doctrine of rebirth have ceased
to be useful members of their community by adopt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>ing
a life of indolence, thereby bringing reproach on
these so-called higher teachings. If your friends will
have none of this teaching, leave them alone. Making
converts is by no means the essential point of the Rosicrucian
teaching. The Guardian of the Gate will not
examine them as to knowledge, and he may admit
some who are entirely ignorant of this matter and
shut the door in the face of others who have devoted
their lives to studying, lecturing on, and teaching
these laws.</p>

<p>Then if the doctrines of “Causation” and “Rebirth”
are unessential, what about the <em>complex constitution
of Man</em>? Surely it is essential to know that
we are not merely this visible body, but have a vital
body to charge it with energy, a desire body to spend
this force, a mind to guide our exertions in channels
of reason, and that we are virgin spirits enmeshed in
a threefold veil as egos. Is it not essential to know
that the physical body is the material counterpart of
the Divine Spirit, that the vital body is a replica of
the Life Spirit, and that the desire body is the shadow
of the Human Spirit, the mind forming the link between
the threefold spirit and the threefold body?</p>

<p>No, <em>it is not essential to know these things</em>. Properly
used, this knowledge is an advantage, but it may also
be a very decided disadvantage in the case of those
who have only “a little knowledge” in that direction.
There are many such who are always meditating on
“the higher self” while entirely forgetful of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
many “lower selves” groaning in misery at their very
doors. There are many who dream day and night of
the time when they will take their daily <em>soul flights</em>
as “invisible helpers” and ease the sufferings of the
sick and sorrowful, yet would not spend a five cent
car fare and an hour’s time to bring a poor, friendless
soul in a city hospital a flower and a word of cheer.
Again I say that the Guardian of the Gate is more
likely to admit him who did what he could than him
who dreamed much and did nothing to help his suffering
fellow man.</p>

<p>If you could get people to study the Rosicrucian
teachings about death and the life after, you would
feel it important that they should also know about the
silver cord remaining unbroken for a period approximating
three and one-half days after the spirit has
left the body, and that it must be left undisturbed
while the panorama of its past life is being etched into
the desire body to serve as arbiter of its life in the
invisible world. You would like them to know all
about the spirit’s life in purgatory—how the evil acts
of its life react upon it as pain to create conscience
and keep it from repeating in a later life the acts that
caused the suffering. You would have them know
how the good acts of life are transmuted into virtues
usable in later lives as set forth in our philosophy.</p>

<p>You have no doubt been surprised at the assertion
that a knowledge of the great twin laws is unessential.
Probably the next assertion that it is immaterial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
whether others learn about the constitution of man as
we know it may have scandalized you; and you will
undoubtedly feel shocked to have it stated that the
Rosicrucian teachings concerning death and the passing
of the spirit into the unseen worlds are also comparatively
unnecessary to the purpose we aim to
accomplish. It really does not matter whether your
relatives understand or believe in these teachings. So
far as your own passing is concerned, an earnest request
that they leave your body quiet and undisturbed
for the proper period will probably be carried out to
the letter, for people have an almost superstitious regard
for such “last requests”; and if any of your
friends pass over, <em>you</em> are there with your knowledge
and can do the right thing for them. So never mind
if they refuse to take up that part of the Rosicrucian
teaching.</p>

<p>But the student may say, “If a knowledge of the
before mentioned subjects which seems of such practical
value is immaterial to advancement, then it
follows that study of the Periods, Revolutions, World
Globes, etc., is entirely so. That disposes of everything
taught in the ”<cite>Cosmo</cite>,“ and there is nothing left
of the Rosicrucian teaching which we have embraced
and to which we have pinned our faith!”</p>

<p><em>Is nothing left?</em> Yes, indeed, <span class="smcap lowercase">ALL IS LEFT</span>, for those
things mentioned are only the husks which you must
remove to get at <em>the meat in the nut</em>, the kernel of it
all. You have read the “<cite>Cosmo</cite>” many times perhaps.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
Maybe you have studied it and feel proud of your
knowledge of the world mystery, but <em>have you ever
read the mystery hidden in every line</em>? That is the
great and essential teaching, the one teaching to which
your friends will respond, if you can find it and give
it to them. The “<cite>Cosmo</cite>” preaches on every page <span class="smcap lowercase">THE
GOSPEL OF SERVICE</span>.</p>

<p>For our sakes Deity manifested the universe. The
great creative Hierarchies have all been and some of
them still are <em>our servants</em>. The luminous star angels,
whose fiery bodies we see whirling through space,
have worked with us for ages, and in due time Christ
came to bring us the spiritual impetus needed at that
time. It is also significant in the extreme that in the
parable of the last judgment Christ does not say,
“Well done, thou great and erudite <em>philosopher</em>, who
knoweth the Bible, the Kabala, the ‘<cite>Cosmo</cite>,’ and all
the other mysterious literature which reveals the intricate
workings of nature”; but He says, “Well done,
thou good and faithful servant: * * * enter thou
into the joy of thy lord. * * * * For I was an
hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and
ye gave me drink; * * *.” Not one single
word about knowledge; <em>the whole emphasis was laid
upon faithfulness and service</em>.</p>

<p>There is a deep occult reason for this: <em>service builds
the soul body</em>, the glorious wedding garment without
which no man can enter into the kingdom of the
heavens, occultly termed “<em>The New Galilee</em>,” and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
does not matter whether we are aware of what is going
on, so long as we accomplish the work. Moreover, as
the luminous soul body grows in and around a person,
this light will teach him or her about the Mysteries
without the need of books, and one who is thus God-taught
knows more than all the books in the world
contain. In due time the inner vision will be opened
and the way to the Temple shown. If you want to
teach your friends, no matter how skeptical they may
be, they will believe you if you preach the gospel of
service.</p>

<p>But you must <em>preach by practice</em>. You must become
a servant of men yourself if you would have
them believe in you. If you want them to follow,
you must lead, or they will have the right to question
your sincerity. Remember, “ye are a city upon a
hill,” and when you make professions they have a
right to judge you by your fruits; therefore <em>say little,
serve much</em>.</p>

<p>There are many who love to discuss the harmless,
peaceful life at dinner, oblivious of the fact that the
red roast on the table and the cigar in the mouth dull
the effect. There are others who make a god of the
stomach and would rather study dietetics than the
Bible; they are always ready to buttonhole their
friends and discourse upon the latest food fad. I knew
one man who was at the head of an esoteric group.
His wife was antagonistic to occultism and the meatless
diet. He forced her to cook his vegetables at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
home, and told her that if she ever dared to bring
meat into <em>his</em> kitchen or contaminate <em>his</em> dishes with
it, he would pitch her and the dishes into the street,
adding that if she must make a pig of herself she
could go and get flesh food in a restaurant.</p>

<p><em>Is it to be wondered at that she judged the religion
by the man and would have none of it?</em> Surely he was
to blame, being “his brother’s keeper,” and though
this is an extreme case, it makes the lesson more
obvious. It is to the everlasting praise of Mahomet
that his wife became his first disciple, and it speaks
volumes for his kindness and consideration in the
home. His is an example we should all do well to follow
if we would win our friends to the higher life, for
though all religious systems differ outwardly <em>the
kernel of all is</em> <span class="smcap lowercase">LOVE</span>.</p>

<span class="smcap">Stumbling Blocks</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Not infrequently</span> the remark is made by
people who have no sympathy with or aspirations
to live the higher life, that it unfits people for
the world’s work. Unfortunately it cannot be denied
that there is seeming justification for the assertion,
though in reality the very first requisite for living
the higher life involves an obligation to comport
oneself irreproachably in dealing with material matters,
for unless we are faithful in the little things, how
can we expect to be trusted with greater responsibilities?
It has therefore been deemed expedient to devote
a lesson to the discussion of some of the things
which act as stumbling blocks in the life of aspirants.</p>

<p>In the Bible story where the king sent out his servants
with invitations to the feast he had prepared,
we are told that his invitations were refused on various
grounds. Each one had material cares, buying,
selling, marrying, therefore they could not attend to
the spiritual things, and such people we may say
represent the greater number of humanity today, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
are too engrossed in the cares of the world to devote
even a thought to aspiration in the higher direction.
But there are others who become so enthusiastic upon
the first taste of the higher teachings that they are
ready to give up all work in the world, repudiate
every obligation, and devote their time to what they
are pleased to call “helping humanity.” They will
readily admit that it takes time to learn how to be a
watchmaker, a shoemaker, an engineer, or a musician,
and they would not for a moment dream of giving up
their present material business to establish themselves
as shoemaker, watchmaker, or music teacher
just because they felt enthusiastic about or inclined to
take up such work. They would know that lacking
the proper preparation and training they would be
doomed to failure, and yet they think that just because
they have become enthusiastic over the higher
teachings they are at once fitted to step out of the
world’s work and devote their time to service similar,
even though in a lesser degree, to that rendered by
the Christ in His ministry.</p>

<p>One writes to Headquarters: “I have given up flesh
eating, and I long to live the ascetic life, far from
the world’s noise that jars upon me. I want to give
my life for humanity.” Another says: “I want to
live the spiritual life, but I have a wife who needs my
care and support. Do you think I would be justified
in leaving her to help my fellow men?” Still another
says:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> “I am in a business which is unspiritual; every
day I must do things which are against my higher
nature, but I have a daughter dependent upon me for
an education. What shall I do: continue or give up?”
There are of course many other problems presented
to us, but these serve as fair samples, for they represent
a class which is ready to give up the world at the
slightest word of encouragement, and rush off to the
hills in the expectation of sprouting wings immediately.
If the people who are in that class have any
ties, they break them without a scruple or a moment’s
consideration.</p>

<p>Another class still feels some obligation, but could
be easily persuaded to repudiate it in order that they
might live what they call “the spiritual life.” It
cannot be denied that when people get into this state
of mind, when they lose their ambition to work in the
world, when they become shiftless and neglectful of
their duties, they merit the reproach of the community.</p>

<p>But as already said such conduct is based upon a
misunderstanding of the higher teachings and is not
at all sanctioned by the Bible or the Elder Brothers.</p>

<p>It is a step in the right direction when a person
ceases to feed on flesh because he feels compassion
for the suffering of the animals. There are many
people who abstain from flesh foods for health’s sake,
but theirs being a selfish motive, the sacrifice carries
with it no merit. Where the aspirant to the higher
life is prompted to abstain from flesh food because he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
realizes that the refining influence of a meatless diet
upon the body will aid him in his quest by making
the body more sensitive to spiritual influences, there
is no real merit either. Truly, the person who abstains
from flesh foods for the sake of health will be much
benefited, and the person who abstains to make his
body more sensitive will also get his reward in that
respect, but from the spiritual point of view neither
will be very much better. On the other hand, whoever
abstains from flesh food because he realizes that
God’s life is immanent in every animal just as in himself,
that in the final analysis God feels all suffering
felt by the animal, that it is a divine law, “Thou shalt
not kill,” and that he must abstain out of compassion,
this person is not only benefited in health and by
making his body more sensitive to spiritual impacts,
but because of the motive which prompts him he
reaps a reward in soul growth immeasurably more
precious than any other consideration. Therefore
we would say by all means abstain from flesh food,
but be sure to do so prompted by the right spiritual
motive or it will not affect your spiritual interests
one iota.</p>

<p>When the enthusiast says that he wants to get away
from the world and the noise that jars upon him to
live the ascetic life, it is truly a strange idea of service.
The reason why we are here in this world is that
we may gather experience, which is then transmuted
into soul growth. If a diamond in the rough were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
laid away in a drawer for years and years, it would
be no different than before, but when it is placed
against the grindstone by the lapidary the harsh
grinding process removes the last atom of the rough
coating and brings out the beautiful, luminous gem.
Every one of us is a diamond in the rough, and God,
the Great Lapidary, uses the world as a grindstone
which rubs off the rough and ugly coating, allowing
our spiritual selves to shine forth and become luminous.
The Christ was a living example of this. He
did not go away from the centers of civilization, but
moved constantly among the suffering and the poor,
teaching, healing, and helping until by the glorious
service rendered, His body was made luminous on the
Mount of Transfiguration, and He who had trodden
the Way exhorted His followers to be “in the world
but not of it.” That is the great lesson that every
aspirant has to learn.</p>

<p>It is one thing to go out in the mountains where
there is no one to contradict or to jar upon our sensibilities
and keep our poise there; it is another thing
entirely to maintain our spiritual aspirations and
keep our balance in the world where everything jars
upon us; but when we stay on this path, we gain a
self-control which is unattainable in any other manner.</p>

<p>However, though we are careful to prepare our food
well and to abstain from flesh eating or any other
contaminating <em>outward</em> influence, though we want to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
get away to the mountains to escape the sordid things
of city life, and we want to rid ourselves of every
outward thing that may prove a stumbling block to
our progress, still what about the things that come
from <em>within</em>, the thoughts we have in our minds and
our mental food? It will avail us not one iota of good
if we could feed our bodies upon nectar and ambrosia,
the ethereal food of the gods, when the mind is a
charnel house, a habitat of low thoughts, for then
we are only as whited sepulchres, beautiful to behold
from without but inwardly full of a nauseating
stench; and this mental delinquency can be maintained
just as easily and perhaps it is even more apt
to be maintained in the solitude of the mountains or
in a so-called spiritual retreat than in a city where we
are busy with the work of our vocation. It is indeed a
true saying that “an idle brain is the devil’s workshop,”
and the safest way to attain to interior purity
and cleanliness is to keep the mind busy all the time,
guiding our desires, feelings, and emotions toward
the practical problems of life, and working, each one
in his own immediate environment, to find the poor
and the needy that he may give them whatever help
their cases require and merit. That class which has
no ties of its own may profitably make ties of love
and friendship with those who are loveless and friendless.</p>

<p>Or if it is the care of a relative—wife, daughter,
husband, or anyone else that claims us, let us remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
the words of Christ when He said, “Who are my
mother and my brother?” and answered the question
by saying, “Those who do the will of my Father.”
This saying has been misconstrued by some to mean
that the Christ repudiated His physical relationships
for the spiritual, but it is only necessary to remember
that in the last moments of His life on earth He called
to Him the disciple whom He loved and brought him
to His mother, giving him to her as a son and charging
the disciple to care for His parent. Love is the
unifying force in life, and according to the higher
teachings we are required to love our kin, but also to
extend our love natures so that they may also include
everyone else. It is good that we love our own mother
and father, but we should also learn to love other
people’s mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers,
for universal brotherhood can never become a fact so
long as our love is confined only to the family. It
must be made all inclusive.</p>

<p>There was one among the disciples of Christ whom
He loved especially, and following His example we
also may bestow a particular affection upon certain
ones, though we ought to love everyone and do good
even to them that despitefully use us. These are
high ideals and difficult of accomplishment at our
present stage of development, but as the mariner
steers his ship by a guiding star and reaches his desired
haven though never the star itself, so also by
setting our ideals high we shall live nobler and better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
lives than if we do not aspire, and in time and through
many births we shall eventually attain, because the
inherent divinity in ourselves makes it imperative.</p>

<p>Finally then, to sum up, it does not really matter
where we are placed in life, whether in a high station
or a low. Present environment with its opportunities
and limitations is such as suits our individual requirements
as determined by our self-made destinies in previous
existences. Therefore it holds for us the lesson
we must learn in order to progress properly. If we
have a wife, a daughter, or other family relations to
hold us to that environment, they must be considered
as part of what we have to reckon with, and by doing
our duty to them we learn the required lesson. If
they are antagonistic to our belief, if they have no
sympathy with our aspirations, if we have on their
account to stay in a business and do things which we
are not pleased with, it is because we must learn something
from these things, and the proper way for the
earnest aspirant is to look conditions squarely in the
face with a view to finding out just what it is that is
needed. This may not be an easy matter. It may
take weeks, months, or years to solve the problem, but
so long as the aspirant applies himself prayerfully to
the task, he may be sure that the light will shine some
day, and then he will see what is required and why
these conditions were imposed upon him. Then having
learned the lesson or found out its purpose, he will
if he has the right spirit prayerfully bear the burden,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
for he will know that he is upon the right road and
that it is an absolute certainty that as soon as the
lesson of that environment has been learned a new
way will be opened up showing him the next step
upon the path of progress. Thus the “stumbling
blocks” will have been turned into “stepping stones,”
which would never have happened if he had run
away from them. In this connection we would quote
the beautiful little poem:</p>

<span class="smcap">The Lock of Upliftment</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Have you</span> ever seen how ships going up a canal
or river are lifted from one level to another?
It is a very interesting and instructive process. First
the ship is floated into a small enclosure where the
water level is the same as that of the lower part of
the river where the ship has previously been sailing.
Then the gates of the enclosure are shut and the ship
is cut off from the outside world by the high walls of
the lock. It cannot go back to the river without;
even the light is dimmed around it, but <em>above</em> the
moving clouds or the bright sunshine are seen beckoning.
The ship cannot rise without assistance, and the
law of gravitation makes it impossible for the water
in that part of the river where the ship has been sailing
to float it to a higher level, hence no help may be
looked for from that source.</p>

<p>There are also gates in the upper part of the lock
which prevent the waters on the higher levels from
rushing into the lock from above, otherwise the in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>rushing
water would flood the lock in a moment and
crush the ship lying at the bottom level because acting
in conformity with that same law of gravitation. It
is from <em>above</em>, nevertheless, that the power must come
if the ship is ever to be lifted to the higher level of
the river, and so to do this safely a <em>small stream</em> is
conducted to the bottom of the lock, which lifts the
ship <em>very slowly and gradually but safely</em> to the level
of the river above. When that level has been reached,
the upper gates may be opened without danger to the
ship, and it may sail forth upon the expansive bosom
of the higher waterway. Then the lock is <em>slowly</em>
emptied and the water it contained added to the
water at the lower level, which is thereby raised even
if but slightly. The lock is then ready to raise another
vessel.</p>

<p>This is, as said in the beginning, a very interesting
and instructive physical operation, showing how human
skill and ingenuity overcome great obstacles by
the use of nature’s forces. But it is a source of still
greater enlightenment in a spiritual matter of vital
importance to all who aspire and endeavor to live the
higher life, for it illustrates the only safe method
whereby man can rise from the temporal to the spiritual
world, and it confutes those false teachers who
for personal gain play upon the too ardent desires of
the unripe, and who profess ability to unlock the
gates of the unseen worlds for the consideration of an
initiation fee. Our illustration shows that this is im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>possible,
because the immutable laws of nature forbid.</p>

<p>For the purpose of elucidation we may call our
river the river of life, and we as individuals are the
ships sailing upon it; the lower river is the temporal
world, and when we have sailed its length and
breadth for many lives, we inevitably come to the lock
of upliftment which is placed at the end. We may
for a long time cruise about the entrance and look in,
impelled by an inner urge to enter but drawn by
another impulse towards the broad river of life without.
For a long time this lock of upliftment with its
high, bare walls looks forbidding and solitary, while
the river of life is gay with bunting and full of
kindred craft gaily cruising about; but when the
inner urge has become sufficiently intense, it finally
drives us into the lock of upliftment, and it imbues
us with a determination not to go back to the river of
worldly life. But even at that stage there are some
who falter and fear to shut the gate behind them;
they aspire ardently at times to the life on the higher
level, but it makes them feel less alone to look back
upon the river of worldly life, and sometimes they
stay in this condition for lives, wondering why they
do not progress, why they experience no spiritual
downpouring, why there is no uplift in their lives.
Our illustration makes the reason very plain; no matter
how hard the captain might beg, the lock keeper
would never think of releasing the stream of water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
from above until the gate had been closed behind the
ship, for it could never lift the ship an inch under
such conditions but would flow through the open
gates to waste in the lower river. Neither will the
guardians of the gates of the higher worlds open the
stream of upliftment for us, no matter how hard we
pray, until we have shut the door to the world behind
us, and shut it very tight with respect to the
lust of the eyes and the pride of life, the sins that so
easily beset us and are fostered by us in the careless
worldly days. We must shut the door on them all
before we are really in a condition to receive the
stream of upliftment, but once we have thus shut the
door and irrevocably set our faces forward, the downpouring
begins, slowly but surely as the stream of the
lock keeper which lifts the vessel.</p>

<p>But having left the temporal world with all its
deeds behind and having set his face towards the
spiritual worlds, the yearning of the aspirant becomes
more intense. As time passes he feels in increasing
measure the void on both sides of himself. The
temporal world and its deeds have dropped from him
as a garment; he may be bodily in that world, performing
his duties, but he has lost interest; he is in the
world but not of it, and the spiritual world where he
aspires to citizenship seems equally distant. He is all
alone and his whole being cries and writhes in pain,
longing for light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

<p>Then comes the turn of the tempter: “I have a
school of initiation, and am able to advance my pupils
quickly for a fee,” or words to that effect, but usually
more subtle; and who shall blame the poor aspirants
who fall before the wiles of these pretenders? Lucky
are they if, as is generally the case, they are merely
put through a ceremonial and given an empty degree,
but occasionally they meet one who has really dabbled
in magic and is able to open the flood gates from the
higher level. Then the inrush of spiritual power
shatters the system of the unfortunate dupe as the
waters of the river above would wreck a vessel at the
bottom of the lock if an ignorant or malicious person
were to open the gates. The vessel must be lifted
slowly for safety’s sake, and so must the aspirant to
spiritual upliftment; patience and unwavering persistence
in well-doing are absolutely indispensable,
and the door to the pleasures of the world must be
kept closed. If that is done we shall surely and certainly
accomplish the ascent to the heights of the unseen
world with all the opportunities for further soul
growth there found, for it is a natural process governed
by natural laws, just as is the elevation of a
ship to the higher levels of a river by a system of
locks.</p>

<p>But how can I stay in the lock of upliftment and
serve my fellow man? If soul growth comes only by
service, how can I gain by isolation? These are questions
that may not unnaturally present themselves to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
students. To answer them we must again emphasize
that no one can lift another who is not himself upon
a higher level, not so far above as to be unreachable,
but sufficiently close to be within grasp of the reaching
hand. There are, alas, too many who profess the
higher teachings but live lives on the level with ordinary
men and women of the world or even below that
level. Their professions make the higher teachings a
byword and call down the scorn of scoffers. But
those who live the higher teachings have no need to
profess them orally; they are isolated and marked in
spite of themselves, and though handicapped by the
misdeeds of the “professors,” they do in time win the
respect and confidence of those about them; eventually
they call out in their associates the desire of
emulation, they convert them in spite of themselves,
reaping in return for this service a commensurate
soul growth.</p>

<p>Now is the time of the year (Christmas) when the
crest wave of spiritual power envelops the world. It
culminates at the winter solstice, when the Christ is reborn
into our planet, and though hampered by the
present (from the limited viewpoint) deplorable war
conditions, His life given for us may be most easily
drawn upon by the aspirant at this season to further
spiritual growth; therefore all who are desirous of attaining
the higher levels would do well to put forth
special efforts in that direction during the winter
season.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Cosmic Meaning of Easter</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="center">PART I</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">On the morning</span> of Good Friday, 1857, Richard
Wagner, the master artist of the nineteenth
century, sat on the verandah of a Swiss villa by the
Zurich Sea. The landscape about him was bathed in
most glorious sunshine; peace and good will seemed to
vibrate through nature. All creation was throbbing
with life; the air was laden with the fragrant perfume
of budding pine forests—a grateful balm to a
troubled heart or a restless mind.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, as a bolt from an azure sky, there
came into Wagner’s deeply mystic soul a remembrance
of the ominous significance of that day—the
darkest and most sorrowful in the Christian year. It
almost overwhelmed him with sadness, as he contemplated
the contrast. There was such a marked incongruity
between the smiling scene before him, the
plainly observable activity of nature, struggling to
renewed life after winter’s long sleep, and the death
struggle of a tortured Savior upon a cross; between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
the full-throated chant of life and love issuing from
the thousands of little feathered choristers in forest,
moor, and meadow, and the ominous shouts of hate
issuing from an infuriated mob as they jeered and
mocked the noblest ideal the world has ever known;
between the wonderful creative energy exerted by
nature in spring, and the destructive element in man,
which slew the noblest character that ever graced our
earth.</p>

<p>While Wagner meditated thus upon the incongruities
of existence, the question presented itself: Is
there any connection between the death of the Savior
upon the cross at Easter, and the vital energy which
expresses itself so prodigally in spring when nature
begins the life of a new year?</p>

<p>Though Wagner did not consciously perceive and
realize the full significance of the connection between
the death of the Savior and the rejuvenation of
nature, he had, nevertheless, unwittingly stumbled
upon the key to one of the most sublime mysteries encountered
by the human spirit in its pilgrimage from
clod to God.</p>

<p>In the darkest night of the year, when earth sleeps
most soundly in Boreas’ cold embrace, when material
activities are at the very lowest ebb, a wave of spiritual
energy carries upon its crest the divine creative
“Word from Heaven” to a <em>mystic birth</em> at Christmas;
and as a luminous cloud the spiritual impulse broods
over the world that “knew it not,” for it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span> “shines in
the darkness” of winter when nature is paralyzed
and speechless.</p>

<p>This divine creative “Word” has a message and a
mission. It was born to “save the world,” and “to
give its life for the world.” It must of necessity
sacrifice its life in order to accomplish the rejuvenation
of nature. Gradually it <em>buries itself in the earth</em>
and commences to infuse its own vital energy into the
millions of seeds which lie dormant in the ground. It
whispers “the word of life” into the ears of beast and
bird, until the gospel or good news has been preached
to every creature. The sacrifice is fully consummated
by the time the sun crosses its Easter(n) node
at the spring equinox. Then the divine creative Word
expires. <em>It dies upon the cross at Easter</em> in a mystical
sense, while uttering a last triumphant cry, “It has
been accomplished” (consummatum est).</p>

<p>But as an echo returns to us many times repeated,
so also the celestial song of life is re-echoed from the
earth. The whole creation takes up the anthem. A
legion-tongued chorus repeats it over and over. The
little seeds in the bosom of Mother Earth commence
to germinate; they burst and sprout in all directions,
and soon a wonderful mosaic of life, a velvety green
carpet embroidered with multicolored flowers, replaces
the shroud of immaculate wintry white. From the
furred and feathered tribes “the word of life” re-echoes
as a song of love, impelling them to mate.
Generation and multiplication are the watchwords<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
everywhere—<em>the Spirit has risen</em> to more abundant
life.</p>

<p>Thus, mystically, we may note the annual birth,
death, and resurrection of the Savior as the ebb and
flow of a spiritual impulse which culminates at the
winter solstice, Christmas, and has egress from the
earth shortly after Easter when the “word” “<em>ascends
to Heaven</em>” on Whitsunday. But it will not remain
there forever. We are taught that “thence it shall
return,” “at the judgment.” Thus when the sun
descends below the equator through the sign of the
scales in October, when the fruits of the year are
harvested, weighed, and assorted according to their
kind, the descent of the spirit of the new year has its
inception. This descent culminates in birth at Christmas.</p>

<p>Man is a miniature of nature. What happens on
a large scale in the life of a planet like our earth,
takes place on a smaller scale in the course of human
events. A planet is the body of a wonderfully great
and exalted Being, one of the Seven Spirits before
the Throne (of the parent sun). Man is also a spirit
and “made in their likeness.” As a planet revolves
in its cyclic path around the sun whence it emanated,
so also the human spirit moves in an orbit around its
central source—God. Planetary orbits, being ellipses,
have points of closest approach to and extreme deviation
from their solar centers. Likewise the orbit of
the human spirit is elliptical. We are closest to God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
when our cyclic journey carries us into the celestial
sphere of activity—heaven, and we are farthest removed
from Him during earth life. These changes
are necessary to our soul growth. As the festivals of
the year mark the recurring events of importance in
the life of a Great Spirit, so our births and deaths are
events of periodical recurrence. It is as impossible
for the human spirit to remain perpetually in heaven
or upon earth as it is for a planet to stand still in its
orbit. The same immutable law of periodicity which
determines the unbroken sequence of the seasons, the
alternation of day and night, the tidal ebb and flow,
governs also the progression of the human spirit, both
in heaven and upon earth.</p>

<p>From realms of celestial light where we live in
freedom, untrammeled by limitations of time and
space, where we vibrate in tune with infinite harmony
of the spheres, we descend to birth in the
physical world where our spiritual sight is obscured
by the mortal coil which binds us to this limited
phase of our existence. We live here awhile; we die
and ascend to heaven, to be reborn and to die again.
Each earth life is a chapter in a serial life story, extremely
humble in its beginnings, but increasing in
interest and importance as we ascend to higher and
higher stations of human responsibility. No limit is
conceivable, for in essence we are divine and must
therefore have the infinite possibilities of God dormant
within. When we have learned all that this world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
has to teach us, a wider orbit, a larger sphere of superhuman
usefulness, will give scope to our greater
capabilities.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“Build thee more stately mansions, O my Soul.</div>
   <div class="verse">As the swift seasons roll,</div>
   <div class="verse">Leave thy low vaulted past;</div>
   <div class="verse">Let each new temple, nobler than the last,</div>
   <div class="verse">Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,</div>
   <div class="verse">Till thou at length art free,</div>
   <div class="verse">Leaving thine outgrown shell by life’s unresting sea.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thus says Oliver Wendell Holmes, comparing the
spiral progression in the widening coil of a chambered
nautilus to the expansion of consciousness which is
the result of soul growth in an evolving human being.</p>

<p>“But what of Christ?” someone will ask. “Don’t
you believe in Him? You are discoursing upon Easter,
the feast which commemorates the cruel death and
glorious, triumphant resurrection of the Savior, but
you seem to be alluding to Him more from an allegorical
point of view than as an actual fact.”</p>

<p>Certainly we believe in the Christ; we love Him
with our whole heart and soul, but we wish to emphasize
the teaching that Christ is the first fruits of the
race. He said that we shall do the things He did,
“and greater.” Thus we are Christs-in-the-making.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>
<p>Thus proclaims Angelus Silesius, with true mystic
understanding of the essentials of attainment.</p>

<p>We are too much in the habit of looking to an outside
Savior while harboring a devil within; but till
Christ be formed <span class="smcap lowercase">IN US</span>, as Paul says, we shall seek in
vain, for as it is impossible for us to perceive light
and color, though they be all about us, unless our
optic nerve registers their vibrations, and as we remain
unconscious of sound when the tympanum of
our ear is insensitive, so also must we remain blind
to the presence of Christ and deaf to His voice until
we arouse our dormant spiritual natures within. But
once these natures have become awakened, they will
reveal the Lord of Love as a prime reality; this on
the principle that when a tuning fork is struck, another
of identical pitch will also commence to sing,
while tuning forks of different pitches will remain
mute. Therefore the Christ said that His sheep
knew the <em>sound</em> of His voice and responded, but the
voice of the stranger they heard not. (John 10:5). No
matter what our creed, we are all brethren of Christ,
so let us rejoice, the Lord has risen! Let us seek Him
and forget our creeds and other lesser differences.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Cosmic Meaning of Easter</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="center">PART II</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Once more</span> we have reached the final act in the
cosmic drama involving the descent of the solar
Christ Ray into the matter of our earth, which is
completed at the Mystic Birth celebrated at Christmas,
and the Mystic Death and Liberation, which are
celebrated shortly after the vernal equinox when the
sun of the new year commences its ascent into the
higher spheres of the northern heavens, having poured
out its life to save humanity and give new life to
everything upon earth. At this time of the year a
new life, an augmented energy, sweeps with an irresistible
force through the veins and arteries of all
living beings, inspiring them, instilling new hope,
new ambition, and new life, impelling them to new
activities whereby they learn new lessons in the school
of experience. Consciously or unconsciously to the
beneficiaries, this outwelling energy invigorates everything
that has life. Even the plant responds by an
increased circulation of sap, which results in additional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
growth of the leaves, flowers, and fruits whereby
this class of life is at present expressing itself and
evolving to a higher state of consciousness.</p>

<p>But wonderful though these outward physical manifestations
are, and glorious though the transformation
may be called which changes the earth from a
waste of snow and ice into a beautiful, blooming
garden, it sinks into insignificance before the spiritual
activities which run side by side therewith. The
salient features of the cosmic drama are identical in
point of time with the material effects of the sun in
the four cardinal signs, Aries, Cancer, Libra, and
Capricorn, for the most significant events occur at
the equinoctial and solstitial points.</p>

<p>It is really and actually true that “<em>in</em> God we live
and move and have our being.” Outside Him we could
have no existence; we live by and through His life;
we move and act by and through His strength; it is
His power which sustains our dwelling place, the
earth, and without His unflagging, unwavering efforts
the universe itself would disintegrate. Now we
are taught that man was made in the likeness of God,
and we are given to understand that according to the
law of analogy we are possessed of certain powers
latent within us which are similar to those we see so
potently expressed in the labor of Deity in the universe.
This gives us a particular interest in the annual
cosmic drama involving the death and resurrection
of the sun. The life of the <em>God Man, Christ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
Jesus</em>, was moulded in conformity with the solar story,
and it foreshadows in a similar manner all that may
happen to the <em>Man God</em> of whom this Christ Jesus
prophesied when He said: The works that I do shall
ye do also; and greater works shall ye do; whither I
go thou canst not follow me now, but thou shalt follow
me afterwards.</p>

<p>Nature is the symbolic expression of God. She
does nothing in vain or gratuitously, but there is a
purpose behind every thing and every act. Therefore
we should be alert and regard carefully the signs in the
heavens for they have a deep and important meaning
concerning our own lives. The intelligent understanding
of their purpose enables us to work so much more
efficiently with God in His wonderful efforts for the
emancipation of our race from bondage to the laws of
nature, and for its liberation into a full measure of
the stature of the sons of God—crowned with glory,
honor, and immortality, and free from the power of
sin, sickness, and suffering which now curtail our
lives by reason of our ignorance and nonconformity
to the laws of God. The divine purpose demands this
emancipation, but whether it is to be accomplished by
the long and tedious process of evolution or by the
immensely quicker pathway of Initiation depends
upon whether or not we are willing to lend our cooperation.
The majority of mankind go through life
with unseeing eyes and with ears that do not hear.
They are engrossed in their material affairs, buying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
and selling, working and playing, without an adequate
understanding or appreciation of the purpose
of existence, and were it unfolded to them it is scarcely
to be expected that they would conform and co-operate
because of the sacrifice it involves.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that the Christ appeals particularly
to the poor and that He emphasizes the difficulty of
the rich entering the kingdom of heaven, for even to
this day when humanity has advanced in the school
of evolution for two millenia since His day, we find
that the great majority still value their houses and
lands, their pretty hats and gowns, the pleasures of
society, dances, and dinners more than the treasures
of heaven which are garnered by service and self-sacrifice.
Although they may intellectually perceive
the beauty of the spiritual life, its desirability fades
into insignificance in their eyes when compared with
the sacrifice involved in attaining. Like the rich
young man they would willingly follow Christ were
there no such sacrifice involved. They prefer rather
to go away when they realize that sacrifice is the one
condition upon which they may enter discipleship. So
for them Easter is simply a season of joy because it is
the end of winter and the beginning of the summer
season with its call of outdoor sports and pleasures.</p>

<p>But for those who have definitely chosen the path
of self-sacrifice that leads to Liberation, Easter is the
annual sign given them as evidence of the cosmic basis
of their hopes and aspirations. As Paul properly states<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
in that glorious fifteenth chapter of 1st Corinthians,
“If Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain,
and your faith is also vain.</p>

<p>“Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God, because
we have testified of God that He raised up
Christ, whom He raised not up if so be that the dead
rise not.</p>

<p>“For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised.</p>

<p>“And if Christ be not raised your faith is vain; ye
are yet in your sins.</p>

<p>“If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are
of all men most miserable.</p>

<p>“If after the manner of men I have fought with
beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me if the dead
rise not?</p>

<p>“But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become
the first fruits of them that slept.”</p>

<p>But in the Easter sun which at the vernal equinox
commences to soar into the northern heavens after
having laid down its life for the earth, we have the
cosmic symbol of the verity of resurrection. When
taken as a cosmic fact in connection with the law of
analogy that connects the macrocosm with the microcosm,
it is an earnest that some day we shall all attain
the cosmic consciousness and know positively for ourselves
by our own experience that there is no death,
but that what seems so is only a transition into a finer
sphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>

<p>It is an annual symbol to strengthen our souls in
the work of well-doing that we may grow the golden
wedding garment required to make us sons of God in
the highest and holiest sense. It is literally true that
unless we walk in the light as God is in the light, we
are not in fellowship; but by making the sacrifices and
rendering the services required of us to aid in the
emancipation of our race we are building the soul
body of radiant golden light which is the special substance
emanated from and by the Spirit of the Sun,
the Cosmic Christ. When this golden substance has
clothed us with sufficient density, then we shall be
able to imitate the Easter sun and soar into the higher
spheres.</p>

<p>With these ideals firmly fixed in our minds, Easter
time becomes a season when it is in order to review
our life during the preceding year and make new
resolutions for the coming season to serve in furthering
our soul growth. It is a season when the symbol
of the ascending sun should lead us up to a keen
realization of the fact that we are but pilgrims and
strangers upon earth, that our real home as spirits is
in heaven, and that we ought to endeavor to learn
the lessons in this life school as quickly as is consistent
with proper service, so that as Easter Day marks the
resurrection and liberation of the Christ Spirit from
the lower realms, so we also may continually look for
the dawn of that day which shall permanently free
us from the meshes of matter, from the body of sin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
and death, together with our brethren in bondage,
for no true aspirant would conceive of a liberation
that did not include all who were similarly placed.</p>

<p>This is a gigantic task; the contemplation of it may
well daunt the bravest heart, and were we alone it
could not be accomplished; but the divine hierarchies
who have guided humanity upon the path of evolution
from the beginning of our career are still active
and working with us from their sidereal worlds, and
with their help we shall eventually be able to accomplish
this elevation of humanity as a whole and attain
to an individual realization of glory, honor, and immortality.
Having this great hope within ourselves,
this great mission in the world, let us work as never
before to make ourselves better men and women, so
that by our example we may waken in others a desire
to lead a life that brings liberation.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Newborn Christ</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It has often</span> been said in our literature that the
sacrifice of Christ was not an event which, taking
place on Golgotha, was accomplished in a few hours
once and for all time, but that the mystic births and
deaths of the Redeemer are continual cosmic occurrences.
We may therefore conclude that this sacrifice
is necessary for our physical and spiritual evolution
during the present phase of our development. As the
annual birth of the Christ Child approaches, it presents
a never old, ever new theme for meditation, from
which we may profit by pondering it with a prayer
that it may create in our hearts a new light to guide
us upon the path of regeneration.</p>

<p>The inspired apostle gave us a wonderful definition
of Deity when he said that “God is Light,” and
therefore “light” has been used to illustrate the
nature of the Divine in the Rosicrucian teachings,
especially the mystery of the Trinity in Unity. It is
clearly taught in the Holy Scriptures of all times
that God is one and indivisible. At the same time we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
find that as the one white light is refracted into
three primary colors, red, yellow, and blue, so God
appears in a threefold role during manifestation by
the exercise of the three divine functions of <em>creation,
preservation, and dissolution</em>.</p>

<p>When He exercises the attribute of <em>creation</em>, God
appears as Jehovah, the <em>Holy Spirit</em>; He is then Lord
of law and generation and projects the solar fertilizing
principle <em>indirectly</em> through the lunar satellites
of all planets where it is necessary to furnish bodies
for their evolving beings.</p>

<p>When He exercises the attribute of <em>preservation</em>
for the purpose of sustaining the bodies generated by
Jehovah under the laws of nature, God appears as the
Redeemer, <em>Christ</em>, and radiates the principles of love
and regeneration <em>directly</em> into any planet where the
creatures of Jehovah require this help to extricate
themselves from the meshes of mortality and egotism
in order to attain to altruism and endless life.</p>

<p>When God exercises the divine attribute of <em>dissolution</em>,
He appears as <em>The Father</em> who calls us back to
our heavenly home to assimilate the fruits of experience
and soul growth garnered by us during the day
of manifestation. This Universal Solvent, the ray of
the Father, emanates from the Invisible Spiritual
Sun.</p>

<p>These divine processes of creation and birth,
preservation and life, and dissolution, death and return
to the Author of our being we see everywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
about us, and we recognize the fact that they are
activities of the Triune God in manifestation. But
have we ever realized that in the spiritual world there
are no definite events, no static conditions; that the
beginning and the end of all adventures of all ages
are present in the eternal “here” and “now?” From
the bosom of the Father there is an everlasting outwelling
of the essence of things and events, which
enters the realms of “time” and “space.” There it
gradually crystallizes and becomes inert, necessitating
dissolution that there may be room for other things
and other events.</p>

<p>There is no escape from this cosmic law; it applies
to everything in the realm of time and space, the
Christ ray included. As the lake which empties itself
into the ocean is replenished when the water that left
it has been evaporated and returns to it as rain, to
flow again ceaselessly toward the sea, so the Spirit of
Love is eternally born of the Father, day by day,
hour by hour, endlessly flowing into the solar universe
to redeem us from the world of matter which enmeshes
us in its death grip. Wave upon wave is thus
impelled outward from the sun to all the planets,
giving a rhythmic urge to the evolving creatures there.</p>

<p>And so it is in the very truest and most literal sense
<em>a newborn Christ</em> that we hail at each approaching
Yule-feast, and Christmas is the most vital annual
event for all humanity whether we realize it or not.
It is not merely a commemoration of the birth of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
beloved Elder Brother, Jesus, but the advent of the
rejuvenating love life of our Heavenly Father, sent
by Him to redeem the world from the wintry death
grip. Without this new infusion of divine life and
energy we should soon perish physically, and our
orderly progress would be frustrated so far as our
present lines of development are concerned. This
is a point we should endeavor to realize thoroughly in
order that we may learn to appreciate Christmas as
keenly as we should.</p>

<p>We may learn a lesson in this respect as in many
others from our children or from reminiscences of our
own childhood. How keen were our anticipations of
the approaching feast! How eagerly we waited for the
hour when we should receive the gifts which we knew
would be forthcoming from Santa Claus, the mysterious
universal benefactor who brought the toys for
the coming year! How would we have felt had our
parents given us the dismembered dolls and broken
drums of yesteryear? It would surely have been felt as
an overwhelming misfortune and would have left a
deep sense of broken trust which even time would have
found it difficult to heal; yet it would have been as
nothing compared with the cosmic calamity that would
befall mankind if our Heavenly Father should fail to
provide the newborn Christ for our cosmic Christmas
gift.</p>

<p>The Christ of last year cannot save us from physical
famine any more than last year’s rain can drench the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
soil again and swell the millions of seeds that slumber
in the earth awaiting the germinal activities of the
Father’s life to begin their growth; the Christ of last
year cannot kindle anew in our hearts the spiritual
aspirations which urge us onward in the Quest any
more than last summer’s heat can warm us now. The
Christ of last year gave us His love and His life to
the last breath without stint or measure; when He was
born into the earth last Christmas, he endued
with life the sleeping seeds which have grown and
gratefully filled our granaries with the bread of
physical life; He lavished the love given Him by the
Father upon us, and when He had wholly spent His
life, He died at Eastertide to rise again to the Father,
as the river by evaporation rises to the sky.</p>

<p>But endlessly wells the divine love; as a father
pities his children, so does our Heavenly Father pity
us, for He knows our physical and spiritual frailty and
dependence. Therefore we are now confidently awaiting
the mystic birth of the Christ of another year,
laden with new life and love sent by the Father to preserve
us from the physical and spiritual famine which
would ensue were it not for this annual love offering.</p>

<p>Younger souls usually find it difficult to disabuse
their minds of the personality of God, of Christ, and
of the Holy Spirit, and some can only love Jesus, the
man. They forget Christ, the Great Spirit, who
ushered in a new era in which the nations established
under the regime of Jehovah will be broken to pieces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
that the sublime structure of Universal Brotherhood
may be built upon their ruins. In time all the world
will realize that “God is spirit, to be worshiped in
spirit and in truth.” It is well to love Jesus and to
imitate him; we know of no nobler ideal and none
more worthy. Could a nobler one have been found,
Jesus would not have been chosen as a vehicle of that
Great One, the Christ, in whom dwelt the Godhead.
We shall therefore do well to follow “in His steps.”</p>

<p>At the same time we shall exalt God in our own
consciousness by taking the word of the Bible that
He is spirit, and that we cannot make any likeness
which will portray Him for He is like nothing in
heaven or on earth. We can see the physical vehicles
of Jehovah circling as satellites around the various
planets; we can also see the sun, which is the visible
vehicle of the Christ; but the Invisible Sun, which is
the vehicle of the Father and the source of all, appears
to the greatest of human seers only as a higher
octave of the photosphere of the sun, a ring of violet-blue
luminosity behind the sun. But we do not need
to see; we can feel His love, and that feeling is never
so great as at Christmas time when He is giving us the
greatest of all gifts, the Christ of the new year.</p>

<span class="smcap">Why I am a Rosicrucian</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Not infrequently</span> we find that some one
takes the platform to explain why he is a Baptist,
Methodist, or Christian Scientist, and what his
particular faith may be. We have often been asked
by our students for something which would help make
plain to their associates why they had embraced the
teachings of the Elder Brothers given through the
Rosicrucian Fellowship, in preference to the faith
which they had left. We will, therefore, endeavor to
give a succinct resume of reasons which appeal to us
as sufficient, but students will doubtless find many
other reasons equally good or better, which they may
add verbally to what is here said.</p>

<p>It should be made clear in the very beginning that
students in the Rosicrucian Fellowship do not call
themselves Rosicrucians. That title applies alone to
the Elder Brothers, who are the hierophants of the
Western Wisdom Teaching. They are as far beyond
the greatest living saint in spiritual development as
that saint is above the lowest fetish worshiper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<p>When the bark of our life sails lightly upon smooth
summer seas, wafted along by the fair winds of health
and prosperity, when friends are present on every
hand, eager to help us plan pleasures which will increase
our enjoyment of this world’s goods, when
social favors or political powers come to us to gratify
our every wish in whatever sphere our inclinations
seek expression, then, indeed, we may say and seem
justified in saying with our whole heart and soul:
“This world is good enough for me.” But when we
come to the end of the smiling sea of success; when
the whirlwind of adversity has blown us upon the
rocky shores of disaster, and a wave of suffering
threatens to engulf us; when friends have failed and
every human help is as far off as it is unavailing,
then we must look for guidance to the skies as does
the mariner when he steers his ship over the waste of
waters.</p>

<p>But when the skipper scans the sky in search of a
star whereby to steer the ship safely, he finds that the
whole heavens are in motion. Therefore to follow almost
any one of the myriad of wandering stars visible
to the eye would be disastrous. To meet the requirements
the guiding star must be perfectly steadfast
and immovable, <em>and there is only one such, namely,
the North Star</em>. By its guiding light the mariner may
steer in full confidence and bring his ship to a haven
of rest and safety. Likewise one who is looking for a
guide which he may trust in days of sorrow and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
trouble should embrace a religion founded on eternal
laws and immutable principles, able to explain the
mystery of life in a logical manner so that his intellect
may be satisfied, and at the same time containing
a system of devotion that may satisfy the heart,
so that these twin factors in life may receive equal
satisfaction. Only when man has a clear intellectual
conception of the scheme of human development is he
in a position to range himself in line therewith. When
it is made clear to him that this scheme is beneficent
and benevolent in the very highest degree, that all is
truly ruled by divine love, then this understanding
will sooner or later call out in him a true devotion and
heartfelt acquiescence which will awaken in him a desire
to become a co-worker with God in the world’s
work.</p>

<p>When seeking souls come to the door of the church
to seek surcease from sorrow, they cannot be satisfied
with the platitudes that it is the will of God that
sorrow and suffering have come to them, that in His
divine providence He has seen fit to scourge them,
and that they must take it as an indication that He
regards them as His beloved children and be satisfied
no matter what happens. They cannot see that Deity
does justice when He makes some rich and many poor,
a few healthy and many sickly; and it is only too
often in evidence that iniquity is prosperous while
rectitude is in rags.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

<p>The Rosicrucian teachings give clear and logical
information concerning the world and man; they invite
questions instead of discouraging them, so that the
seeker after spiritual truth may receive full satisfaction
intellectually; their explanations are strictly
scientific as they are reverently religious. They refer
us for information regarding life’s problems to laws
that are as unchangeable and immutable in their
realm of action as the North Star is in the heavens.</p>

<p>Though the world whirls upon its axis at the rate of
one thousand miles an hour, we stand safely anywhere
upon its surface because the principle of gravity
prevents us from being hurled into space by the
terrific speed. We know that the law of gravity is
eternal; it will not act today and suspend action tomorrow.
When we enter a hydraulic elevator we rest
safely upon a column of water because that fluid is
more incompressible than most solids, and this property
is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Were
its action suspended for even a few moments, thousands
of people would fall to their death; but it is
steadfast and sure, therefore we trust it implicitly.</p>

<p>The law of cause and effect is also immutable; if we
throw a stone into the air, the act is not complete until
by gravitation it has returned to earth. “<em>Whatsoever a
man soweth, that shall he also reap</em>,” is the way this
law is expressed in the realm of morals. “The mills
of God grind slowly, but they grind exceeding small,”
and once an act has been done, the reaction will come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
some time, some where, as surely as the stone that
was thrown into the air will return to the earth.</p>

<p>But it is manifest that all of the causes that we set
going in life do not ripen in the present existence, and
it therefore follows that they must find their fruition
somewhere else at some other time, or the law would be
invalidated, a proposition that would be as absolutely
impossible as that the law of gravitation could be suspended,
for either would make chaos out of cosmos.
The Rosicrucian teachings explain this by a statement
that man is a spirit attending the School of Life for the
purpose of unfolding latent spiritual power, and that
for this purpose he lives many lives in earthly bodies
of increasingly finer texture, which enable him to express
himself better and better. In the lower grades
of this school of evolution man has few faculties.
Each life-day he comes to school in the morning of
childhood, and is given lessons to learn, and at night
when old and gray the nurse maid of nature, “Death,”
puts him to sleep that he may rest from his labors until
the dawn of another life-day, when he is given a new
child body and new lessons. Each day “Experience,”
the teacher of the school helps him to learn some of the
lessons of life, and gradually he becomes more and
more proficient. Some day he will have learned the
entire curriculum of the school, which includes building
of bodies as well as using them.</p>

<p>Thus when we see one who has few faculties, we
know that he is a young soul who has gone to life’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
school only a few days; and when we find a beautiful
character, we recognize an old soul who has spent
much time in mastering its lessons. Therefore we do
not despair of God’s love when we see the inequalities
of life, for we know that in time all will be perfect
as our Father in Heaven is perfect.</p>

<p>The Rosicrucian teachings also take the sting of sorrow
out of the greatest of all trials, the loss of loved
ones, even if they have been what is called wayward
or black sheep; for we know that it is an actual fact
that <em>in God we live and move and have our being</em>;
hence, if one single soul were lost, a part of God would
be lost, and such a proposition is absolutely impossible.
Under the immutable law of cause and effect we are
bound to meet these loved ones some time in the future
under other circumstances, and there the love that
binds us together must continue until it has found its
fullest expression. The laws of nature would be
violated if a stone thrown from the earth were to remain
suspended in the atmosphere, and under the
same immutable laws those who pass into the higher
spheres must return. Christ said, “Ye must be born
again,” and “If I go to my Father, <em>I will return</em>.”</p>

<p>But although our reason may reach into the mysteries
of life, there is still a higher stage, <em>actual first-hand
knowledge</em>. As a matter of fact the foregoing
propositions are capable of verification by each one,
for we all have a <em>sixth sense</em> latent in our being, which
will sometime enable us to view the spiritual world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
with the same distinctness as that with which we see
the temporal. This sixth sense will be developed by
all in the course of evolution, and there are certain
means whereby it may be developed now by all who
care to take the necessary time and trouble to do so.
Some have done this, and they have told us of their
travels in the land of the soul. We believe their testimony
concerning that place just as we believe what
people who have traveled in Africa or Australia tell
us of those countries. And just as we say that <em>we
know</em> the earth rotates upon its axis and revolves in
its orbit around the sun because we have been thus informed
by scientists who have made the investigations
and calculations that establish these facts, so
also we say that <em>we know</em> the dead live, and that
whether dead or alive, in the body or out of it, we are
all enfolded in the love of our Father in Heaven, without
whose Will not the smallest sparrow falls to the
ground, and that He cares for all and orders our steps
in harmony with His plans to develop our spiritual
powers to the highest possible degree.</p>

<p>So because of the logical, soul-satisfying philosophy
of life given by the Rosicrucians, we follow their
teachings in preference to other systems, and invite
others who wish to share the blessings thereof to investigate.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Object of the Rosicrucian Fellowship</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The object</span> of the Rosicrucian Fellowship has
been clearly stated in our literature, as have the
means whereby it is hoped to attain the end in view,
but in response to requests for a succinct summary we
devote this chapter to that subject.</p>

<p>The world is God’s training school. During the
past we have learned to build different vehicles,
among others the physical body. By this work we are
promoted from class to class, each with its particular
scope of consciousness. We evolved eyes that we
might see, ears that we might hear, and other organs
that we might taste, smell, and feel. But not all egos
were promoted at every step. When the mist in the
air at the time of Atlantis condensed and filled the
basins of the earth with oceans of water, driving men
to the highlands, many perished by asphyxiation because
they had not evolved lungs. They could not
pass through the portal of the rainbow, which was,
so to speak, the entrance gate to the new age with its
dry atmospheric conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<p>Another great world transformation is coming, we
know not when; even the Christ confessed His ignorance
of the day and the hour; but He warned us that
the day would come as a thief in the night, and He
prophesied that the conditions in the world would then
be similar to those prevailing in the days of Noah;
they were living then in carefree enjoyment of life
when suddenly the floodgates of heaven were opened,
and death and destruction spread before them.</p>

<p>Christ told us that it is possible to take the kingdom
of God by storm and attain to the consciousness and
conditions there prevailing. But Paul informs us that
flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; he
states that we have a soul body (<i>soma psuchicon</i>—1
Cor. 15: 44), and that we shall meet the Lord <em>in
the air</em> when He comes. This soul body is therefore as
necessary to entrance into the new age of the kingdom
of God, as a body equipped with lungs was to the
Atlanteans who desired to enter into the age in which
we are now living. Therefore it is necessary that we
make our calling and election sure by preparing the
<em>Golden Wedding Garment</em>, the soul body, which alone
can secure our admission to the mystic marriage.</p>

<p>The multitude is slowly moving in the right direction
as led by the different churches, but there is an
ever growing class that, so to speak, feels the wings of
the soul body sprouting, people who feel an inner
urge to take the kingdom of God by storm. Though
unaware of any definite ideal, they sense a greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
truth and a more certain light than those which the
Church radiates; they are tired of parables and long
to learn the underlying facts at the very feet of Christ.</p>

<p>The Rosicrucian Fellowship was started for the
purpose of reaching this class, to show them the way
to illumination, to help them build their soul body
and evolve the soul powers which will enable them to
enter consciously into the kingdom of God and obtain
first-hand knowledge.</p>

<p>This is a large undertaking, none greater and
even under the most favorable existing conditions
progress must be slow, but if the aspirant will continue
with patient perseverance in well doing, it can
be done.</p>

<p>The methods are definite, scientific, and religious;
they have been originated by the Western School of
the Rosicrucian Order, and are therefore specially
suited to the western people. Sometimes, but very
rarely, they bring results in a short time; generally it
requires years and even lives before the aspirant attains,
but the following system will in the end bring
all to their hearts’ desire.</p>

<p>The Tabernacle in the Wilderness was a symbolic
representation of the way to God, and, as Paul says,
held a shadow of better things to come. Everything
in it had its spiritual meaning. The table of shewbread
gives us an important lesson germane to our
present consideration. Students will remember that
the ancient Israelites were commanded to bring the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
shewbread to the tabernacle at stated intervals. The
grain from which this was made was given them by
God but they must prepare the soil in which it was to
grow, they must plant and cultivate, they must weed
and water, so as to secure the greatest possible increase;
they must harvest and thresh, grind and bake,
ere they had the loaves which they brought to the
tabernacle as <em>bread to shew</em> for their toil. Similarly,
God gives to all the grain of opportunity to serve, but
it is our duty to cultivate these opportunities and
nurse and nourish them in the soil of loving kindness
so that they may bring a great increase. We must
always bear in mind the words of Christ that He
came to minister and to serve. Therefore anyone
aspiring to follow in His steps and to be great in the
kingdom of God must ever be on the lookout for opportunities
to serve his fellows. Each day must be
filled as full as possible with kind and considerate
deeds, for they are the warp and woof of which the
<em>golden wedding garment</em> is woven. Without these
“works” no amount of prayer, fasting, or other religious
exercises will avail. It is useless to repair to
the temple without this <em>bread to shew</em> that we have
really worked in the Master’s service.</p>

<p>The foregoing is also the teaching of the exoteric
churches; but the following is the exclusively Rosicrucian
scientific teaching and method, based upon
the deepest knowledge of spiritual facts whereby the
aspirant is enabled to gain the maximum soul growth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
in each life, so that his spiritual advancement is
accelerated beyond his very wildest dreams. Therefore
this is the most important spiritual teaching that
has been given to man in modern times, and no one
who tries honestly to follow this simple method can
fail to be enormously benefited:</p>

<p>Ether is the medium of transmission of light, that
which etches a picture on the photographic film. It
permeates the air, and with every breath we draw
from birth to death ether enters our system and etches
a picture of our surroundings and actions on a little
atom in the heart. Thus each carries with him a complete
record of his life, which is assimilated after
death. Expiation of the evil deeds causes pain and
anguish in purgatory. These are thus transmuted to
conscience to prevent repetition of the same mistakes
in succeeding lives: the good deeds are transmuted to
love and benevolence. Instead of waiting for this
post-mortem transmutation of the shewbread of life,
the aspirant who desires to take heaven by storm may
assimilate the fruits of each day after retiring and
before going to sleep by running over the deeds done.
The events of the day are considered in reverse order,
so that that which happened in the evening is taken
first, then the happenings of the afternoon, forenoon,
and morning. This is important for it conforms to
the way the life panorama acts after death, taking first
the events just prior to death, last the events of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
infancy. The object is to show the effects and then
refer them to their antecedent causes.</p>

<p>In this retrospection it will do the aspirant no good
to run over the events of the day and mildly blame
himself where he did wrong—he is usually sure
enough to praise himself sufficiently for his good
deeds. But he must remember the altar of burnt
offerings where the sacrifices for sin were offered.
They were first rubbed with salt and then placed on
the altar to be consumed by a divinely enkindled fire.
Anyone knows what an intense pain is caused when
salt is rubbed into a wound, and this rubbing with
salt is symbolic of the pain the aspirant must feel for
his wrongdoing. Now mark that it was not permissible
to place the sacrifice on the altar until it had
been thus rubbed with salt. God would not accept it
before, but <em>when it had been salted it was consumed
by a fire kindled by God Himself</em>.</p>

<p>This tells us that unless we have washed our evil
deeds of the day in the salt of our tears and heartfelt
contrition, God will not accept our sacrifice of repentance;
but when we have really repented, our sins
will be washed away and our recording atom will be
clean as the driven snow. With respect to our good
deeds we may remember that there were two little
piles of frankincense on the top of the shewbread.
These were offered upon the altar of incense, where
the smoke ascended as a sweet savor to the Lord, so
different from the nauseating stench that went up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
from the altar where the sin offerings were burned.
Is it any wonder that God took no delight in the sacrifice
of bulls and calves, but delighted in a contrite
heart and a repentant spirit?</p>

<p>It is this spiritual aromatic extract of our good
deeds that builds our soul body. By the ordinary
natural process it takes about one-third as many years
in our post-mortem existence as we lived in the body,
to reap what we have sowed. But when an aspirant
has assimilated the fruits of life by faithful retrospection
at the end of each day, he is free as soon as he
leaves the body and may use the years spent by others
in purgatory and the first heaven as he pleases. Furthermore,
as he needs neither food, shelter, nor sleep,
he may spend twenty-four hours a day doing good.
Thus he has practically as many years of service and
soul growth after death as the number of his earth
life; and being trained and schooled in this work his
attainments are probably greater than could be made
in a number of lives lived in the ordinary way.</p>

<p>To aid deserving aspirants, still deeper and more
definite teachings are given by the Elder Brothers
through the Rosicrucian Fellowship. Students who
feel the inner urge may ask for information concerning
these teachings.</p>

<p>This remarkable book by Max Heindel marks an entirely
new departure in mystic literature.</p>

<p>For the first time in history the <i>Western Wisdom
Teaching</i> concerning Life and Being which the Rosicrucians
have guarded for centuries, is here given by an authorized
messenger, for it is held that the world is ready to receive
this advanced science of the soul, the religious philosophy of
the Aquarian Age, now at hand. The existing soul-hunger
and the satisfying nature of the Rosicrucian teachings are
equally well attested by the phenomenal sale of this great
book, and many thousands of letters received by the author
from grateful students located all over the world, who testify
that they there found what they have long sought elsewhere
in vain.</p>

<p>We give herewith some headings of chapters and subdivisions
as a slight indication of what is contained in this
mine of mystic light and knowledge.</p>

<p class="center">Part I.</p>

<p>The Visible and Invisible Worlds, The Four Kingdoms, Man
and the Method of Evolution. Spirit, Soul and Body;
Thought, Memory and Soul-growth. The conscious, subconscious
and superconscious mind. The science of death, the
beneficence of purgatory, life in heaven. Rebirth and the
Law of Consequence.</p>

<p class="center">Part II.</p>

<p>The Scheme of Evolution. The Path of Evolution. The
Work of Evolution. Genesis and Evolution of Our Solar
System. Chaos the seed-ground of Cosmos, Birth of the
Planets, Planetary Spirits. Evolution of the Earth. The

of Genesis. The Nebular Theory.</p>

<p class="center">Part III.</p>

This philosophy gives a logical analysis of the origin,

It is entirely Christian, aiming to make religion a

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
